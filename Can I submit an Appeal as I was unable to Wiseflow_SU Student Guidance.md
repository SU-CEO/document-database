It is unlikely that you will be able to submit an Academic Appeal if you were unable to use ‘WISEflow’ for your exams. The reason being is that UoB have published lots of information and ‘test exams’ to ensure you are ready to sit your exam.

**TOP TIPS**

- Do a test run in good time before sitting your exam; that way if you do encounter any problems with the application after following UoB instructions they can be hopefully resolved before your exam.
- Apply for Mitigation if you are unable to use WISEflow

An Academic Appeal is usually the very last resort in these types of scenarios.
