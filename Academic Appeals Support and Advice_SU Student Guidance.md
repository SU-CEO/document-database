Receiving exam results and final grades can be a worrying time. You may feel that you haven't been awarded a fair grade or mark and wish to appeal to the University to reconsider their decision.

This can be done through submitting an [academic appeal](https://www.beds.ac.uk/student-experience/academic-information/academic-appeals-policy).

The process may seem confusing and overwhelming, so in way of support we have put together some additional content to help you through the process.

You can access our detailed [Answers and Questions page](https://help.bedssu.co.uk/support/solutions/folders/80000546564) that should have all the information you require.

As well as a step by step [short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBJv-THShAE) to the process
