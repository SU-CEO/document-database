**UNIVERSITY OF BEDFORDSHIRE ACADEMIC APPEAL FORM – STAGE 2**

**Please read the Academic Appeals Policy before completing this form. If you need help completing the form, you should contact the Students’ Union Welfare and Advice team on** [**be.supported@beds.ac.uk**](mailto:be.supported@beds.ac.uk)

**All sections of this form must be completed in full and official supporting evidence must be provided. Please sign and date the form. Your appeal will be delayed if you do not complete this form in full.**

**Your details:**

| Student number |     | Name |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Course title |     | Email address(es) |     |

**Please answer these questions to check your appeal is eligible for consideration**

| **1\. Have you submitted a Stage 1 appeal and received formal notification that it is not upheld?** Please note, the University will only consider an appeal at Stage 2 if a Stage 1 appeal has been considered and is not upheld _(see section 3.32 for taught courses and section 4.26 for postgraduate research courses)._ | YES / NO |
| --- | --- |
| **2\. Are you appealing within 10 working days of receiving your Stage 1 outcome?** Please note that students will be deemed to have received notification on the date the outcome is communicated to them by email _(see section 3.34 for taught courses and page section 4.28 for postgraduate research courses)._ | YES / NO |
| **3\. If you are not appealing within 10 days of receiving your Stage 1 appeal outcome, is there an exceptional reason for this which you would like the University to take into consideration?** If your appeal is submitted late, it will not normally be considered. In exceptional cases, the University may waive these timescales and accept a late appeal if you can demonstrate circumstances that prevented an on-time submission. Any such cases must be supported with relevant documentary evidence (e.g. medical certificate) _(see section 3.23 for taught courses and section 4.18 for postgraduate research courses)._ | YES / NO |
| **4\. Are you providing new evidence or information that is directly related to your Stage 1 appeal?** If your Stage 1 appeal is restated without new evidence or information directly related to your Stage 1 appeal, or new grounds for appeal are introduced, your appeal will be rejected _(see sections 3.35-3.37 for taught courses and sections 4.30-4.32 for postgraduate research courses)._ | YES / NO |

If you have answered 'no' to any of the above questions, it is unlikely that the University will consider your appeal. Please contact the Adjudication Team ([adjudication@beds.ac.uk](mailto:adjudication@beds.ac.uk)) if you need further advice.

If you have answered 'yes' to the above questions, it is likely that your appeal is eligible for consideration. Please complete the rest of this form and send it to the Adjudication Team ([adjudication@beds.ac.uk](mailto:adjudication@beds.ac.uk)).
