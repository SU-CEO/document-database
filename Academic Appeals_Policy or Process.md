The University of Bedfordshire endeavours to resolve all appeals as early as possible and is committed to dealing openly and fairly with you.

Your appeal will be treated seriously and you will not suffer any disadvantage or recrimination as a result of making one.

The [University's Academic Appeals Policy and Procedure [PDF]](https://www.beds.ac.uk/media/w3xjymiq/academic-appeals-policy.pdf)  provides a more detailed breakdown of the criteria and timescales within which students are expected to submit their appeals.

All appeals should be submitted to the Adjudication Team via [adjudication@beds.ac.uk](mailto:adjudication@beds.ac.uk) using the following forms:

- [Stage 1 Academic Appeal form - DOCX 20.2 KB](umb://media/314593fc81594a1585955f66dbcc5216)
- [Stage 2 Academic Appeal form - DOCX 19.4 KB](umb://media/1f17c336861d41a0b555799a5074156d)

Guidance on acceptable evidence to support appeals regarding mitigating circumstances is available [here -  PDF 261.0 KB](umb://media/42bffa7b272b4105b5687fdf804aafd5)

Appeals will not be considered if they do not meet the criteria specified in the academic appeals policy.

- Academic appeals are only valid in respect of Examination Board decisions already made. Therefore the appeals procedure must be followed **after** an Examination Board has taken a decision.
- It is only through the appeals process that issues relating to an Examination Board decision can be resolved.

## The possible outcomes of submitting an appeal

A successful appeal may provide you with a further opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and skills. You may be required to re-do work or complete further assessment to demonstrate the required academic rigor.

## Problems which have affected the completion of work within the deadline set?

Where your ability to perform in an assessment or submit a piece of work is affected by ill health or exceptional extenuating circumstances you should contact the Student Engagement and Mitigation Team **immediately** at [student.engagement@beds.ac.uk](mailto:student.engagement@beds.ac.uk)

## Ill on the day of examination?

You will need to contact the Student Engagement and Mitigation Team immediately using the relevant details above. You will be asked to support your case with evidence or medical documentation from your GP, hospital or the Walk-In Centre.

## Learning from student appeals

We want to continue to improve our services and so we evaluate and analyse student appeals in order to learn from them and improve the student experience.

Student appeals are regularly tracked and monitored by the Adjudication Team and are reported to the Vice Chancellor's Student Experience Group and Academic Board to ensure that our procedures are robust.
