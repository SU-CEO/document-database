During your studies, unexpected circumstances beyond your control may affect your academic performance and progression. In such cases, you can apply for **mitigation** to request an extension or reassessment.

**What is Mitigation?**

Mitigation is the process by which students can apply for an extension or reassessment if they are unable to meet an assessment deadline. This application must be submitted ***on or before the assessment date***.

- You have up to ***7 days after the assessment due date*** to submit your mitigation form. If you submit it late without a valid reason, your request may be refused.
- If you are having trouble completing the form, contact the ***Student Engagement and Mitigation Team (SEAM)*** for assistance.

**Key Points:**

- You are responsible for submitting your mitigation application. It will not be accepted from a third party, including academic staff.
- In ***exceptional cases*** where you are unable to apply yourself, the ***Assistant Head of Student Support*** may consider your circumstances.
