- Your statement must include all the key information, for example, if you’re appealing on the grounds ofextenuating circumstances, it should include an explanation of why the University weren’t told about theseat the time. Simply stating you did not know about the ‘mitigation’ process **will not** be enough for yourappeal to be upheld, you will need to explain why you did not apply for mitigation at that time.
