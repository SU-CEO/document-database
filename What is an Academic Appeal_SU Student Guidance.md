**Academic Appeal**

- An appeal is a request from you for the university to review a decision made about an assessment result, academic progression, or an overall award, where the decision was made without knowing essential information about your circumstances.
- You can submit an appeal if there were circumstances beyond your control that affected your results
- For example, severe illness at the time of the assessment or a university administration issue.

**Grounds for Appeal**

- A – exceptional mitigating circumstances
- B – operational issues impacting academic outcome

**Challenging an Academic Judgement**

- The appeals process **does not allow you to challenge an academic judgement** if you don’t like your grade.
- The university uses [moderation processes and external examiners](https://www.beds.ac.uk/about-us/our-governance/quality/external-examining/) to ensure that marking is fair and consistent across the university.
- If you feel that your work has been unfairly marked, you should seek feedback from your tutor.

Full details of the Academic Appeal process can be found in the [UoB Academic Appeals Policy.](https://www.beds.ac.uk/student-experience/academic-information/academic-appeals-policy)
