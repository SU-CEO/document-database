Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

**1. Definitions**

Throughout this document, the following definitions should be applied:

*“student”* A registered student at the University of Bedfordshire

*“member”* A student member of Beds SU, defined as a registered student of the

```
University of Bedfordshire on a UK campus and any partner institutions where
a partnership agreement has been established with Beds SU, who has not
opted out of Students’ Union membership (see Memorandum & Articles of
Association for further details)

```

*“client”* Any student member who has engaged with the Advice Service

# **2 Principles of the Service**

The Students’ Union (SU) is independent from the University and the operation and

principles of the Advice Service will be in line with the values and policies of the SU. The

Service will be:

- **Free and independent** to all Beds SU members, including those registered with theUniversity of Bedfordshire (UoB) on any of its UK campuses and any partnerinstitutions where a partnership agreement has been established with Beds SU.Advisors will be free from influence and conflict of interest so they can represent thestudent(s) and Inform students of what they can realistically expect from their adviceservice.
- **Empowering** to the students who access it (known as clients). The aim is always toencourage clients to work through their problems or issues themselves, with supportand practical advice. A successful service is one where clients take responsibility fortaking action to resolve their problem or issue. Clients, for example, will write theirown academic appeals, complaints etc.

```
If a client is deemed to be vulnerable and unable to do this or at risk of significant or
immediate harm, safeguarding policies and procedures are to be followed/considered
or the Advice service manager informed.

```

- **Student-centred and accessible.** The service will operate at times and in ways thatmake it accessible to students, providing support face to face (where possible), on-line, and via the telephone. Plain English will be used in materials and informationproduced by the Service and reasonable adjustments will be made where necessary,to meet the differing needs of the student body.

```
In accordance with the SU’s equality and diversity policies, equality of access and
service will be at the heart of its operation and additional advice will be sought (from
UoB or externally) where necessary about how best to support the needs of
particular cohorts of students to ensure continuous improvement and relevance to
our members.

```

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

```
Clear details and operating times of the service will be kept up to date for students on
the SU’s website, social media and at any physical servicing area. Individual clients
will be informed what they can expect from the service and, in relation to their own
case, possible timelines and outcomes, during their first meeting with an Advisor.

```

- **Confidential and professional.** Students can be confident that when they accessthe Service, their matter will be dealt with professionally and appropriately. They willbe informed that we will retain and hold a record about their case, in line with theSU’s GDPR practices and retention schedule and will only be used for legitimatepurposes (see Section 8 below).

```
Clients can opt out of receiving any further support from the service at any time.

```

```
SU Advisors will actively seek to remain up to date with relevant and recurring advice
matters, and identify and build upon knowledge gaps or areas for development.
Advisors will access external and sector-relevant training, information and support to
ensure the knowledge and expertise within the service evolves with changing policy
and student needs so that clients are supported by staff with relevant skills and
experience.

```

- **Accountable**. The Service will ask for feedback from its clients and will monitor itsusage, outcomes, and impact. It will report on these to SLT, with reports sharedinternally, with trustees and/or UoB. Statistics will be maintained and analysed aspart of regular service reviews.

# **3 Scope of the Service**

The Service will provide advice and information to current registered UoB students on any of

its UK campuses and any partner institutions where a partnership agreement has been

established with Beds SU. Advice will cover the following areas of student life:

- Academic
- Financial
- Welfare
- Accommodation

The Service may also provide advice and information to non-students engaged in University

processes relating to a period of study at UoB (i.e. ex-students).

**The Service cannot support** anyone not included in the above Scope of the Service; or a

student for whom the service has been withdrawn.

If you are concerned about the appropriateness of giving advice to a student for whatever

reason, speak to your line manager.

See section 6 below for more details on what would constitute a conflict of interest for the

Service.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

**Students who are suspended or who have interrupted their studies**

Students who have interrupted their studies or are undertaking placement as part of their

study programme may be supported with issues strictly relating to the University and their

experience as a student.

Students who are suspended at the time of seeking advice from the Service can be

supported. Details of the suspension will need to be obtained from the student or University

as they are likely to be prohibited from being on campus. If this is the case, the student can

be supported on-line or by telephone and this will be explained to them.

Suspended students will be identified by:

- Self-disclosure
- Adjudication or other University correspondence (e.g. emails sent from the VC toBeds SU’s Chief Executive Officer).

Students’ suspended status will be recorded on the case recording system, as well as any

associated paperwork received for the student and any outcome of the case provided by

UoB.

**Withdrawal of Service**

In principle, Advisors are expected to be supportive, professional and non-directive in all

their dealings with students engaging in the Service, and every effort made to continue to

support any student seeking advice. From time to time, some situations will mean this is not

possible despite best efforts or intentions.

Beds SU reserves the right to suspend the Service or cease access to the Service to any

student for a legitimate reason outlined here:

- to safeguard the safety and/or or welfare of staff or other students;
- to uphold a policy of Beds SU, including the values of the Beds SU SafeguardingPolicy;
- as a result of inappropriate behaviour (as described below);
- where there is a conflict of interest that cannot be mitigated (as described below);
- a student is no longer a student and is enquiring about a historic issue.

Withdrawal of Service is to be approved by the Advice service manager.

Inappropriate behaviour can be described as follows:

- aggressive or inappropriate verbal or written language towards a staff member,including use of violence or threatening behaviour;
- seeking support for fraud or other illegal conduct;
- vexatious or malicious claims;
- behaviour or declaration that contravenes UK legislation e.g. The Equality Act 2010,The Children Act 1989, The Human Rights Act 1998 etc., or other offensivebehaviour stipulated in the Members Code of Conduct; and,
- a client knowingly provides misleading or false information to an Advisor or Teammember.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

Inappropriate behaviour may also extend to poor engagement with Advisors or the advice

given, such as:

- expressing excessive or unreasonable demands on the Service;
- after warning, persistently failing to attend appointments;
- persistently failing to take the action advised to an extent it is perceived unhelpful orineffective to continue to advise the client; or
- taking action perceived to be harmful to the reputation of the Service.

Conflict of Interest (CoI) is covered in section 6. An unmitigated conflict of interest refers to a

situation where, in providing Advice, the principles of the Service, the law or the Service’s

ethos of impartiality is at risk. Examples of unmitigated conflict of interest include situations

where:

- a client is receiving or looking for advice from another advice agency or is takinglegal advice;
- a client wishes to take action which would result in harm or unfair loss to anotherperson;
- the circumstances of a client’s case inhibit an ability to advise another client’s caseunconflicted and this cannot be resolved within the Service capacity;
- advice is sought on an issue involving Beds SU or its personnel; or
- it becomes apparent that a student seeking advice is committing or has committed acrime and advice is not related to supporting the student to navigate a UoB processas a result of the crime committed (i.e. the student is part of a police investigation,rather than a University investigation).

At all times, Advisors should keep in mind the Union’s Safeguarding Policy and escalation

procedures therein.

**Protocol for withdrawal of service**

If you are concerned about the appropriateness of giving advice to a client for whatever

reason, speak to your line manager. Withdrawal of Service is to be approved by the Advice

service manager.

In instances of inappropriate behaviour, where possible and appropriate the client will be

given a written warning that the service may be withdrawn from them should they continue to

act in this way.

If the Service is withdrawn from a client, we will:

- notify the client in writing of the decision and the reason(s) why; and
- where available, provide details of an appropriate alternative source of advice andassistance.

Where a client is committing or has committed a crime:

- the Advisor will warn them of the implications of their actions and ensure that advicepertains solely to UoB processes;
- if the client is solely seeking legal advice, the Advisor will signpost them toappropriate services, bring the interview to an end, and decline to give further adviceon this matter;
- the situation will be treated with utmost seriousness and line manager consulted.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

At all times, Advisors should keep in mind the Union’s Safeguarding Policy and escalation

procedures therein.

Where a student is no longer a registered UoB student, the student will be referred to

publicly available information to follow up their enquiry.

# **4 How members access the Service**

Our members – current students of UoB – are able to access the service through:

- Face to face enquiry
- At a designated ‘drop-in’ session (face to face or on-line)
- Email help@bedssu.co.uk (students are encouraged to use their @study.beds.ac.ukemail addresses for IT security and protection reasons)
- On-line contact form - available on our website
- Via referrals from staff in the SU and UoB departments. Referrals will not beaccepted from a 3rd party e.g. a friend or family member of a student unless thestudent confirms their consent to this in writing (e.g. by email). If you are unsureabout any such referral, consult your line manager.

Whatever the method of initial contact, the student will be asked to provide some basic

information, which will be standardised (e.g. outline of enquiry, contact details/University

number etc.).

If you are concerned about a student not being able to access the Service for whatever

reason, report it to a team meeting at earliest convenience.

**Cases will be fairly allocated** to Advisors by the Advice service manager or nominee, who

will prioritise urgent cases and have discretion in any allocation process. In the absence of

cases being allocated, Advisors will support the Team Manager and take a proactive

approach to supporting new and existing casework, particularly when the Manager or

nominee is out of the office.

It is important that all Advisors gain experience and knowledge in all areas of advice offered

by the Service. There may be occasions where a case is allocated to a particular advisor for

reasons of their experience but Advisors will be encouraged to learn from their colleagues,

undertake training and shadow each other in order that they can increase their own

knowledge. It is very important that clients receive an equitable service, regardless of which

Advisor supports them.

Consideration will be given, at the Advice service manager’s discretion, to requests relating

to case allocation from clients, however the SU will not be responsible for any detriment to a

case arising from any client request. The client should be advised of any risk to their case in

such an instance.

Prior to responding to an email from a student, checks must be done on the case recording

system that the student is not already accessing the Service with an active case. In

particular, it is the responsibility of each Advisor to check for warnings noted on case files or

conflicts of interest.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

Appointments will be held:

- Face to face
- On-line (Teams/Zoom) - any log in details will be made available to Advisors
- By telephone

Advice will not be provided outside of the working environment, unless specific permission

has been sought by management.

Specific arrangements may be made for ‘group’ advice workshops or sessions on particular

topics, which will safeguard the principles of the Service as far as possible.

Advisor are encouraged to demonstrate flexibility and are actively encouraged to seek out

any ‘reasonable adjustments’ we can make to support our members to access our service in

line with Beds SU equality and diversity values.

**If an Advisor is uncomfortable** with meeting a client alone for whatever reason (whether

face to face or on-line) they should speak to their line manager so that appropriate measures

can be put in place.

# **5 Service Standards**

**Incoming emails** must be responded to within two Working Days. If it is identified that this is

not going to be possible for whatever reason, this should be flagged with the Advice Team to

seek a solution.

**If a client needs a response urgently** , for example has a hearing in less than 72 hours,

they will be contacted to give them initial advice. This may well include that the client asks

for a time extension on the hearing to enable them to seek appropriate, independent advice.

**When a student attends the service in person** with an enquiry, if it is determined that the

case may be urgent, every effort will be made to have an initial conversation with them to

determine the best course of initial action, even if a full appointment is not possible at that

time.

**Appointments** with clients will be allocated for **one hour** and should never exceed this time.

This appointment time will include any initial, immediate action that needs to be taken by the

Advisor e.g. contacting a tutor and basic notes/records.

Regular and ongoing dialogue regarding casework with Advice colleagues is expected, with

the Advice Manager notified of any complex cases.

**When an appointment is arranged,** relevant and timely notice/details is/are to be provided

to the client along with a copy of the Advice Service Standards (if not previously shared).

If a client fails to attend an appointment, they should be contacted to check their welfare, and

the appointment rearranged if possible.

During peak times or periods of absence, Advisors are expected to be proactive and work as

a team. There may be a need to increase the number of appointments or ‘drop-in’ sessions

made available to students during these times.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

**When calling a client** , particularly in an open plan office or when working remotely, you

must make every opportunity to respect the privacy of the client and wear headphones. If

you are working from home, it is good practice to explain this to the client and that their call

cannot be overheard (or indeed, if it can be overheard and by whom).

Telephone calls outside of the UK are discouraged (i.e. unless absolutely necessary) and so

on-line appointments will be offered in those circumstances.

**On-line appointments** (using the SU’s agreed platform) must always be conducted in an

appropriate and professional setting that respects a client’s privacy and confidentiality.

Details of appointments will be recorded in the ‘be supported’ Outlook calendar and **mustnot** be recorded or visible in Advisors’ individual Outlook calendars. Advisors areresponsible for ensuring that their available appointment times are clearly marked for thefollowing days/week.

When a case is active and an Advisor is on a period of leave or absence, the client must be

informed if this affects the progress of their case, and an alternative Advisor assigned to the

case, if necessary. Advisors are expected to support each other in the best interests of each

client.

**Case correspondence/notes** should be uploaded onto the enquiries system by end of the

working day (at the latest) of the client being advised. If this is not possible, you must inform

your line manager.

**Case notes** should be uploaded onto the case recording system by end of the working day

(at the latest) of the case being closed (see section 10 re case closure). If this is not

possible, you must inform your line manager.

**Consent forms must** be completed by the client before sharing information about them with

any third party. If you want to refer a client to another department or staff member/Officer

within the SU, you must seek their permission in writing first e.g. by email.

All Advisors are expected to work within GDPR regulations and more details of this can be

found in Section 8 below.

# **6 Conflicts of Interest**

Where a conflict of interest is identified - either when a student first approaches the Service

or in a meeting with them - Advisors are responsible for taking appropriate action to manage

this.

**A conflict of interest arises when** :

- it is impossible for us to give independent and impartial advice to a client;
- in the view of the client, we are unable to give independent and impartial advice;and/or
- an Advisor becomes aware that a client has acted fraudulently.

Examples include:

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

- clients who are in conflict with Beds SU in any way;
- clients making a complaint against an SU Advisor;
- two (or multiple) opposing parties (students) who are in a dispute. Where the Serviceidentifies a potential conflict of interest which necessitates informing one party thatwe cannot act on their behalf, this may draw attention to the fact that we are alreadyacting on behalf of another party so this needs to be dealt with sensitively.

In this scenario, the Service will continue to advise the client who approached the Service

first and for whom a case has been opened. In dialogue with the client, the SU will explore

other avenues for the conflicted student to receive advice, as far as reasonable and

possible. In any situation, separation and confidentiality between clients must be maintained.

**In every CoI situation, Advisors must do the following** :

- If it becomes apparent during a meeting with a client, inform the client that you thinka CoI situation may have arisen and bring the meeting to a close in a sensitive anddiplomatic way;
- inform your line manager (or their line manager if they are unavailable) and agree away forward;
- inform the client of the agreed way forward;
- record the details and actions on their case notes on nominated case recordingsystem. Include name/s of the other party/ies involved and flag that it is a CoI caseon each profile.

Where CoI cannot be mitigated, Withdrawal of Service may be necessary (see page 5 ).

# **7 Confidentiality**

The Service provided to students is confidential and professional. Advisors may discuss

cases between themselves and SU managers. Advisors are to use their professional

discretion in supporting cases in accordance with the Advice Service Standards.

No discussion or correspondence that could identify clients of the service are to take place

outside of the service, its staff or SU managers.

Computer screens must be locked when Advisors are away from their desks and measures

taken to ensure conversation involving cases is not audible to persons external to it.

No details or information about a client will be shared directly or indirectly with a third party

without their consent.

**Instances where a client’s confidentiality may be breached** (which will, also, be set out

in the Advice Service Standards sent to them on arranging an appointment), include:

- where required to by Act of Parliament;
- where required to by order of a Court of Law;
- where an Advisor believes there to be a substantial threat of harm, either of the clientthemselves or another person;
- some occasions when legally permitted;
- where the Service has identified a Conflict of Interest.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

In these instances, the client will usually be informed of the action that is going to be taken

and the reasons why. This will not happen if it is agreed by management that informing the

client would lead to further risk to the client or another person.

In all instances, you **must** inform your line manager (or their line manager if they are

unavailable) and the final decision is made by management on whether or not to breach

confidentiality. A written record of the discussion and decision will be placed on the client’s

case file; a flag/warning placed on the client’s file to ensure visibility in future casework

instances; and **must** be raised with the Service’s line-managing SLT member so it can be

noted at the next SLT meeting.

**Any information supplied to a third party** must be factual and free from opinion or bias.

Only supply information on what you have seen or heard, not what you think – it is very

important not to make assumptions. Any disclosures to a third party must be reflected in the

case notes for the client.

Case files, including case notes and copies of correspondence will be held on a password

protected case management system.

In all of these instances, the **SU Data Protection Policy and Procedures** will be followed.

If an **accidental breach of confidentiality** occurs you must inform your line manager

immediately (or their line manager if they are unavailable) to agree the appropriate action,

and follow the SU’s data breach policy.

All **statistical recording** shall be anonymous. The Service will use statistical information to

identify who is using it and to monitor trends. The SU can take action on issues that are

affecting a number of students by using anonymised data, for example in SU Officer

campaigns.

# **8 Data Handling and GDPR**

Beds SU takes its responsibility to data protection very seriously and ensures compliance

with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018. Procedures and privacy notices

of the SU (including its Data Privacy Statement) will be made available to students via the

SU’s website. Information will also be contained within the Advice Service Standards sent to

students when an appointment is arranged with them, as well as via an email disclaimer on

help@bedssu.co.uk.

This information will explain to clients the **legitimate reasons** for holding and recording their

data and the basis on which it will be used and retained, as well as for how long. It will, also,

explain the client’s rights under GDPR, outlined below.

The Service may access existing data held by the students’ union, such as drawing student

data from its membership database to supplement case recording, casework and analysis.

Students can find out what data the SU holds on them via [http://www.bedssu.co.uk/dataprotection.](http://www.bedssu.co.uk/dataprotection.)

The Service records the **personal data** of clients and stakeholders in order to ensure that

we provide clients with our service the correct advice, and to effectively communicate with

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

them. It also collects information, such as gender and nationality, for statistical purposes only

e.g. to help monitor which groups are accessing the Service and identify gaps in reach.

Students approaching the service will be asked to provide their personal information, such

as:

- Personal contact details
- Course details
- Optional demographic data for legitimate purposes

Any data collection should be in line with the SU Data Protection Policy and should include:

- Confidentiality statements they must sign
- A declaration confirming the student’s understanding of how their data is processedin line with the SU’s Data Storage Policy
- Consent to discuss their case and/or share relevant information with necessaryparties in the progress of their case

**Students who are returning to the Service** will be encouraged to share their personal

information again when a new case is opened for them.

Advisors are to consult the Data Protection Champion (or relevant manager) with queries

relating to data handling, storage, policy or procedure.

The Service will strive to be entirely **paperless** and uses secure online case recording

software for case information recording and storage, alongside a secure online enquiry

handling system. This software is only available to Beds SU staff. One profile will be created

for each student/client (e.g. a client may have multiple open and closed cases attached to

their profile).

Advisors must digitalise information and destroy paper files or forms as soon as this is done.

Advisors must transfer any information relating to a client that has been stored temporarily to

another platform as soon as possible to the case recording system and delete the

information on the temporary platform immediately afterwards. Other platforms should not be

used to retain or permanently store client case records, e.g. sanctioned SU shared drive,

and may result in disciplinary action.

If a client is unable to complete any forms in digital format, advisors are encouraged to

support clients with an alternative process where possible. All hard copies or non-

encrypted/non-password-protected versions of personal data must be destroyed at the

earliest convenience, in accordance with the SU Data Protection Policy.

**Case notes** will be recorded in terms of what the Advisor has been told (by a client or

person referring them) and not what the Advisor thinks. Plain English will be used and jargon

avoided.

Case notes ensure a record of the service provided; they support ongoing and future

casework; and notes demonstrate due diligence and accountability. Case notes allow for

scrutiny in instances of query, issue or complaint; and they are required for insurance

purposes. Crucially, case notes must also allow colleagues to effectively support cases in a

particular Advisor’s absence.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

Case notes should include:

- General correspondence
- Details of discussions within the appointment and agreed actions/ follow up;
- Any identified concerns or potential safeguarding issues;
- Any specific request from the client regarding their data;
- Any reasonable adjustments that need to be made for the client to enable them toaccess the service;
- Other professionals or agencies involved in the case;
- Completed third party consent forms and other relevant forms;
- Any other relevant information.

Advisors are also required to record into case notes the time spent on particular tasks (such

as by way of existing or new functionality in the case recording system), as well as any

further monitoring fields required by the Advice service manager or SLT.

Advisors may be required to record case notes in a consistent manner to colleagues,

including in particular ways set out by the Advice service manager. Such will aid monitoring

of the service.

All **case files will be recorded and stored** securely in line with the SU’s GDPR/Data

Protection procedures and processes. Case records are retained and securely held in line

with the Beds SU Data Retention Policy (for 6 years after the academic year in which the last

recorded piece of work was carried out by an Advisor).

**At least annually** the Advice service manager will meet with the Data Protection Champion

(or SLT delegate) to review data/online forms held in the service and identify data for

deletion. Such may include email archives and Advice Service Machforms will be deleted by

the Service or expired case records. This is to ensure no unnecessary retention of sensitive

data occurs. Student data can only be deleted from the case recording system when

authorised by the Advice service manager.

**Annual audits** will be arranged by the Service’s management to ensure it is compliant with

the SU’s retention schedule and GDPR principles.

**Clients’ rights** under GDPR are:

- **The right to be informed/privacy notices** - Privacy notice ensures that clients areaware of how we store and use their data. A link to this notice and generalinformation is included in contact forms and emails.
- **The right of access** - A client can request a copy of their own case records. Thiscan be a full copy of the file or just certain documents. These can be requested underthe SU’s Data Protection Policy (under Subject Access Request). However, requestsdo not need to be made via this format, and the Service can provide a client with theirrecords following a written or verbal request - the Data Protection Champion must beinformed if a request for data is received. The Service will require the client to provideevidence of their identity (such as their University of ID card, driving license orpassport) before the information is released.
- **The right to rectification** - If a client has concerns about the accuracy of theinformation that the Service holds they can contact the service and their details will

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

```
be updated. If a client is concerned that their case records do not portray an accurate
report of the advice given, they should be referred to the Advice service manager to
discuss how this should be recorded. Appropriate amendments will be made within
one month.

```

- **The right to erasure** - A client can request that the Service erases their personaldata. The Data Protection Champion must be consulted prior to responding to theserequests. The SU will consider the request and the reasons for the request. However,it may not be possible for the SU to grant the right of erasure where we havelegitimate interests to keep the data. For example, it may be necessary for theService to retain case-file records for a period of six years for the purposes ofdefending court action.
- **The right to restrict processing** - A client can request that the Service ceasesfurther processing of their data. The Data Protection Champion must be consultedprior to responding to these requests.
- **The right to data portability** - The Service will make data available to clients in anaccessible format. In practice this is likely to mean that requests for case recordsfrom the case recording system in a standard format. The Data Protection Championmust be consulted prior to responding to these requests.
- **The right to object** - The Service will never use a client’s data for direct marketingpurposes.
- **Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling** - The Servicedoes not use automated decision making or profiling.

If a client wants to exercise any of their rights above, they need to contact

su.data@beds.ac.uk. The SU should respond to the client within one month.

**Sharing data outside the service** may sometimes it may be necessary to support clients

with their case e.g. landlords. The client’s express, written permission will be sought before

doing this.

# **9 Case Review and Advisor Supervision**

Advisors are required to constructively engage in technical casefile review and peer

reflection. The procedure for such review and reflection will be set by SLT. Advisors will also

engage in supervision/ 1 - 2 - 1s as per wider employee culture at Beds SU.

**Technical casefile reviews** contribute to quality assurance in the Service and personal

development. In casefile reviews, Advisors will be asked to discuss and reflect upon the

Advisor’s approach to supporting the case, identifying any areas of compliance,

development or good practice.

Notes and any follow-up actions of the review must be recorded and saved onto the

Advisor’s employee file and, where appropriate, the case recording system. Advisors are to

discuss any follow-up actions with their line manager.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

Casefile reviews are audited annually to note trends and broader actions.

An **annual audit of the case file reviews** will take place to monitor trends or broader

actions.

During their supervision/1- 2 - 1s, Advisors are expected to reflect objectively on their

performance, raise any concerns or barriers around the case, and seek ways to increase

their knowledge where there may be gaps in being able to support an individual student. The

SU will agree to training and development opportunities for staff according to the needs of

the Service and available budgets.

External consultants/services may be utilised to support review and supervision.

**New members of the team** will be supported and supervised (fortnightly during their

probationary period) by an experienced Advisor and be given the opportunity to shadow

them in their work.

**Employee welfare support** is available from the SU’s Employee Assistance Programme,

details of which can be found on the Union’s HR Hub. Additional support may be offered and

will be considered upon request, such as therapeutic supervision/off-loading sessions.

Advisors will receive an **annual personal development review** in line with the processes

for all staff within the SU.

**Team meetings** will also take place on a monthly basis to discuss wider case issues and to

enable continuous service development and improvement. It is important that Advisors and

their manager identify any trends or themes that may lead to potential SU Officer campaigns.

Team communication and regular dialogue is expected outside of meetings. For example,

using communication tools such as Slack. Clients’ names must only be used where

necessary and with regard to confidentiality procedures herein, such as when referring to

appointments.

# **10 Case Closure and Service Feedback and Analysis**

**Cases will be deemed closed when:**

- The client and/or Advisor confirms there is no more work to be carried out on thecase;
- The matter has been referred to another agency in all areas the Service wasassisting the client in;
- The case has run its full course, e.g. all available procedures have been exhausted;
- The Service has ceased to act for the client for whatever reason;
- There has been no contact from the client regarding the case for a period of 3months.

The case recording software should be updated appropriately when closing files and should

include any key reflections or learning from the case.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

Upon closing a case, case notes should reflect the reason for closure. Set protocols for case

closure in case management software may be set by the Advice service manager (or SLT) to

aid service monitoring.

Advisors are expected to close cases in a timely manner, at least once per month. For

example, where no further contact has been received from a student, the student may be

contacted to follow-up on support provided or seek confirmation of closure.

It is very important to seek feedback from clients to ensure continuous Service improvement.

In any follow-up during a dormant or closing case, Advisors should include requests for

student feedback on the service in line with any set evaluation protocol. The advice service

manager will set out the means by which feedback is obtained.

In instances where students provide us with feedback in other ways e.g. via email, Advisors

should liaise and develop a suitable means to securely record, store and share this

information with existing monitoring.

The Service management will ensure regular analysis and reporting of service usage and

impact to enable continuous service improvement, as well as to inform wider SU campaigns

or programmes of work. It will also record interactions and contacts with students that

require a very simple response and which do not result in any case file.

**11. Referral and alternative support for members (including Officer Referrals)**

There may be occasions when the Service is unable to support a student with a particular

issue due to the knowledge and skill base within the team. Such students should be referred

to an alternative source of help, wherever possible.

The student should be encouraged to access that service and refer themselves but there

may be students who require additional support with the process. Advisors should exercise

caution in the level of information they provide about a student to another service or

organisation and will always obtain express, written permission from the student before

contacting another service on their behalf.

Some organisations will have a bespoke referral process so it is advisable to check this

before making a referral. In rare instances, it may be possible to support a student in

attending an external appointment but all such cases should be discussed with your line

manager.

With regards to a **student’s health and wellbeing** , avoid offering views or advice on what

you perceive to be their state of mind or health. If they state they are feeling unwell,

however, encourage them to seek support from a professional service provided by their GP

or UoB.

Details of all referrals should be recorded on the case records system within a client’s

individual case record.

A list of useful organisations and services that students may be referred or signposted to can

be found on the Beds SU website.

Advice Service Manual (for Advisors)

Some cases may need to be **referred to the SU’s Executive Officers** for further action at a

senior level. In these cases, an Officer Referral Form should be completed, detailing the

case and what avenues have been explored to date to resolve the issues. This form should

be sent to the Executive Committee who will liaise with the relevant senior member of UoB

staff (or nominate another Officer or senior SU staff member to do so). The Advisor is to

maintain contact with the Executive to receive updates on any referrals, and consult SLT if

queries arise.
