Getting timely and useful feedback on academic work is an important part of university for many students, as it can help them identify key areas to improve on in future exams and assessments.

However, many students are unaware that they should be getting a minimum standard of quality from the university when it comes to receiving feedback on their work.

So, Beds SU have put together a list of what every Beds student is entitled to when it comes to feedback. This information is specified in official university policy documents such as the UoB Quality Handbook – but we’ve read it and summarized it here, so you don’t have to!

**1. Feedback within specified timeframes**

Students are entitled to receive feedback within specified timeframes, but these are slightly different depending on your level and mode of study. For example:

- If you are in **Foundation Year, First Year, or Second Year** of an Undergraduate degree, or if you are studying for a **Master’s degree**, then you should receive written feedback and marks within **20 working days** of submitting an assignment
- If you are in **Final Year of an Undergraduate degree**, then you should receive written feedback and marks within **15 working days** of submitting an assignment
- If you are studying on **any course in block format**, then you should receive written feedback and marks within **10 working days**

In rare circumstances where these deadlines cannot be met (such as due to staff sickness!), you should be clearly notified of when you should expect your feedback.

If you have not received your feedback within these timeframes and have not been notified of any exceptional circumstances, then you are within your rights to complain to the unit coordinator. Alternatively, feel free to contact Beds SU at help@bedssu.co.uk and we will happily help to get any delays in feedback resolved for you ASAP!

**2.Feedback that you can actually understand**

Feedback on your assignments is important as it can help you identify areas for improvement on future pieces of work. So, it is vital that students can actually understand the feedback that they have been given.

If you feel your feedback is too general for instance, or if you don’t understand how it relates to the marking criteria or assignment brief, you have the right to request further clarity from academic staff.

If you do not feel comfortable contacting academic staff directly, you can raise your concerns with Beds SU at help@bedssu.co.uk and we can help you determine the best way forward.

**3. Meetings with academic staff to clarify feedback**

Although many students find it helpful to discuss their feedback with academic staff to get further clarity on it, many don’t know they are entitled to actually do so! There are a few ways you could go about seeking further clarity on your feedback, some of which are:

- **Make an appointment with your Personal Academic Tutor (PAT).** One of the key responsibilities of PATs is to help students make sense of the feedback they receive on their academic work. All full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at Beds are entitled to a minimum of 3 meetings with their PAT per academic year. You should be able to make an appointment with them at any time by getting in touch via email, and you can normally find their contact details on eVision.
- **Attend the unit lecturer’s designated office hours or email them to set up a meeting to discuss your feedback.** Many academics are very willing to meet with students to explain assignment feedback further, and to provide advice on how to improve performance.
- **Attend a ‘PAT Feedback Week’ meeting.** PAT Feedback Weeks coincide with the end of semesters/blocks and are intended as opportunities for students to meet their PAT after major assessment points to reflect on their feedback and set actions to help improve future assessment performance. During PAT Feedback Weeks,your PAT should get in touch with you to arrange a meeting. You can find further information as well as dates for upcoming PAT Feedback Weeks here:[https://www.beds.ac.uk/patfeedback](https://www.beds.ac.uk/patfeedback)

**4. You can also get written feedback on exams!**

Many students don’t know that they can get written feedback on exams as well as assignments.

This is not normally provided to students in the same way that assignment feedback is – instead, you must explicitly request it. To do so, contact the unit coordinator for the module and ask for them to supply written feedback on your exam.
