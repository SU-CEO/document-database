# Student complaints | University of Bedfordshire

The University of Bedfordshire is committed to maintaining an effective procedure to allow all members of its community to make legitimate complaints.

Our [Student Complaints Policy and Procedure [PDF]](https://www.beds.ac.uk/media/u0lnnyhu/student-complaint-policy-revised-july-2021.pdf) sets out how student concerns may be addressed, and has been established with the aim of resolving complaints informally through negotiation between individuals immediately concerned with the matter and their immediate line management, where possible.

Where informal pursuit of a complaint proves unsatisfactory and requires intervention of objective parties, the formal stages of the Student Complaints Procedure (Stages 2 and 3) are available to students.

Alternatively, concerns, comments and suggestions may be raised via our [Student Voice form](https://www.beds.ac.uk/student-experience/student-voice/)

## Students at our partner colleges

If you are studying at one of our partner colleges your complaint should be dealt with under that college’s local complaints process and you will need to raise your complaint directly with them.

If you have exhausted the complaint process locally, you may pursue a formal investigation at Stage 2 of the University of Bedfordshire’s Complaint Procedure.

## Student advocacy

If you require guidance in submitting your complaint, please contact the Students' Union (Beds SU) who will be able to advise you. Beds SU is an independent organisation and has a team of professional and experienced advice workers that can assist you with your complaint.

## Learning from student complaints

We want to continue to improve our services and so we evaluate and analyse student complaints in order to learn from them and improve the student experience.

Student complaints are regularly tracked and monitored by the Adjudication Team and reported on to the Vice Chancellor’s Student Experience Group and Academic Board to ensure that the procedures are robust in addressing concerns raised.
