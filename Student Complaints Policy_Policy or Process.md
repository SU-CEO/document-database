# **1. Purpose**

1 The University of Bedfordshire is committed to maintaining an effective procedure to allow legitimate

complaints to be made about services which fail to deliver to the University’s standards. This Policy provides

details of the University’s Complaints Procedure for students who wish to make a Complaint.

# **2. Scope**

2 The Student Complaints Policy has been established with the aim, where possible, of resolving complaints

informally through negotiation between those immediately concerned with the matter and, where appropriate,

their immediate line management. The University recognises, however, that some issues cannot be resolved

thro ug h an informal process and may require the intervention of others. The formal stages of the Student

Complaints Policy are therefore available to students, thro ug h Adj ud icatio n, should Informal pursuit of a

Complaint not result in a satisfactory resolution.

3 The Complaints Policy covers all st udents of the Universi ty, taught and rese arch, students with visiting

student status, distance learners and those undertaking apprenticeships.

4 The University aims to deal openly, fairly and effectively with any comment or complaint about services, and

to offer an appropriate remedy to any student who is adversely affected by a service which fails to deliver to

the University's standards.

5 A Complaint will not normally be investigated if a period of three months has elapsed since the alleged action

that is the basis of the Complaint. The Head of Adjudication may exceptionally allow such a Complaint to

proceed, but the student will need to provide a valid reason, with formal evidence, for not being able to make

a Complaint within the relevant timeframe.

6 A Complaint is defined as the expression of a specific concern about the provision of an academic or related

service by the University relating to:

a) The teaching and learning experience of the student, eg quality of teaching, facilities, personal tutor

support.

b) Academic services eg computer and library services.

c) Administrative services, eg Registry, Finance, etc.

This list is not exhaustive and other areas may be considered under this Policy which the University considers

as a Complaint.

7 The University reserves the right to re-direct Formal Complaints into alternative policies and procedures as

it sees fit.

8 The Student Complaints Procedure excludes certain Complaints where the University has separate policies

to deal with these, for example:

a) Academic Appeals and Procedures – appealing against the outcome of academic decisions – managed

by Adjudication.

b) Academic Discipline – relating to academic offences, for example cheating, collusion, plagiarism, work

created by a third party – managed by Academic Services.

c) Student Code of Conduct (Disciplinary) - disciplinary offences including complaints by students about

the be ha vio ur of other stude nts – managed by Adjudication.

d) Mitigating Circumstances – relating to mitigatio n in relation to assessments – managed by the Student

Engagement and Mitigation Team (SEAM).

e) Harassment – complaints concerning harassment – managed by Adjudication and Human Resources.

f) Whistleblowing - making disclosures in the public interest – managed by Human Resources.

g) Complaints concerning admissions onto a course of study – managed by the Admissions Team.

This Complaints Policy cannot be used for any of the above purposes, although in exceptional circumstances

an Academic Appeal may follow a successful Complaint.

9 If a student contacts the Vice-Chancellor or any member of the Executive Group or University directly, without

initially following the University’s Complaints procedure, the Complaint will be referred to the Adjudication

Team.

10 The Student Complaints Policy sets out the expectations of the University in respect of staff participation in

the complaints process (see Witnesses and Representation).

11 All Complaints will be taken seriously, investigated fully and can be made without fear of penalty.

12 We recognise the sensitive nature of cases and privacy will be maintained w herever possible. We will only

share the information and evidence submitted in a Complaint where it is strictly necessary in order to process,

investigate, and consider the Complaint fully. All information received from a Complainant will be handled

sensitively and in accordance with the principles of General Data Protection Regulations.

13 The University of Bedfordshire is a diverse, outward looking and inclusive place to study, live and work. We

are committed to promoting dignity, respect, tolerance and inclusion in all our activities and we work to sustain

an equal and safe environment in a culture of prevention of discrimination of any kind. No person (student,

staff or visitor) shall be unlawfully discriminated against, either directly or indirectly, on the grounds of their

perceived race, colour, ethnic or natural origin or nationality, religious or political beliefs, age, gender,

transgender status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, offending background, other personal

characteristic or for any other reason.

14 We are here to support Complainants and if there is a particularly sensitive issue to raise, the Complainant

can approach the Students’ Union or Student Support for help. We will endeavour to make sure that any

suc h Complaint is known to the smallest number of staff necessary to undertake a thorough investigation

and that staff deal with the Complaint on a confidential basis.

15 The Adjudication Team will brief Investigators on the process and cases. All Investigators and Panel

# **members will receive equality and diversity and/or other specialist training as required.**

16 Students will be entitled to receive a Completion of Procedures letter to take their case to the Office of the

Independent Adjudicator if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the procedures that have been applied

to them.

# **Other Partners and Providers**

17 Complaints by students who are taught at a partner institution, where the Complaint relates to that partner

i nstitutio n, s ho ul d raise this initially in accordance with the partner institution’s Complaints Procedure. This

should be addressed to the partner institution’s Registrar, or the Head of its Administration, and the Complaint

will be conducted under that institution’s own procedures.

18 If the student is not satisfied with the outcome, or the way in which their Complaint has been handled by the

partner institution, they can make a Complaint under the University of Bedfordshire’s Complaints Procedure.

The student will need to provide evidence of their Complaint and the outcome they received from the partner

i nstitutio n. T he Complaint will normally be raised at Formal Stage O ne of the University’s Complaints

Procedure.

19 Where a student who is taught at a partner institution raises a Complaint that relates to the actions of the

University of Bedfordshire, it will be initiated under this Policy.

# **Placements**

20 In certain circumstances, it will be necessary for the Registrar and Secretary to determine whether a

Complaint should proceed through the University's Student Complaints Policy or through an alternative

process (for example, where the Complaint relates to placement operations).

21 Students on work placement are expected to use the Complaints Procedure of the placement provider if the

Complaint relates to issues within the placement itself and where the University cannot reasonably be

expected to have had any involvement.

22 If the Complaint relates to issues where the University can reasonably be expected to have had some

involvement, or the issues have impacted on the student’s learning experience, the student should follow this

Procedure.

# **Students’ Union**

23 Complaints from students who are dissatisfied in their dealing with the University of Bedfordshire Students’

Union (Beds SU) will normally be dealt with under their own Complaints Procedure.

# **3. Policy and Procedure**

# **Underlying Principles**

24 The underlying principles of the University of Bedfordshire Student Complaints Policy, which should be

respected by all those involved, are that:

a) Complaints will be treated seriously, fairly, as quickly as possible and in a consistent fashion;

b) Complaints will be treated in a rigorous and fair manner with sensitivity and minimum stress to all parties

concerned;

c) confidentiality will be respected throughout;

d) submission of a Complaint will not lead to recrimination or adversely affect academic progression

provided it is made in good faith and not maliciously or vexatiously;

e) there is a right for any decision to be subject to further review, including at the final stage, and referral

to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA);

f) the use of the Student Complaints Policy does not affect a student’s right to pursue legal remedies

outside of the University.

25 The University strongly encourages the informal resolution of complaints at the earliest opportunity, before

the Formal process under this Policy is required.

# **What is a Complaint?**

26 A Complaint is defined as the expression of a specific concern about the provision of an academic or related

service by the University relating to:

a) The teaching and learning experience of the student, eg quality of teaching, facilities, personal tutor

support.

b) Academic services eg computer and library services.

c) Administrative services, eg Registry, Finance, etc.

This list is not exhaustive and other areas may be considered under this Policy which the University considers

as a Complaint.

27 The University reserves the right to re-direct Formal Complaints into alternative policies and procedures as

it sees fit.

28 If a Complaint is not based on the grounds specified in this Policy or accompanied by appropriate supporting

evidence, the University will indicate that no action will be taken. The Complainant will receive a Completion

of Procedures Letter and may, if they wish, pursue the matter further with the Office of the Independent

Adjudicator for Higher Education.

# **Who can make a Complaint?**

29 Any registered and current student can make a Complaint. This includes taught and rese arch stude nts,

those with visiting student status, distance learners and undertaking apprenticeships.

30 If a third party is making a Complaint on behalf of a student, they will need written consent from the student

and a valid reason as to why the student is unable to raise a Complaint the mselves. Under the UK’s Data

Protection law, without a student’s consent, the Uni versity will not be able confirm whether that person is, or

was, a student at the University or investigate the Complaint.

31 The University does not accept anonymous Complaints, unless the Complainant can provide a valid reason

for w anti ng to remai n a no ny mo us. Anonymous allegations are less easy to investigate a nd it will be at the

discretion of the Head of Adjudication, in consultation with the Registrar and University Secretary , t o

determine whether the Complaint will be considered anonymously, taking into account:

a) the seriousness of the issues raise d;

b) the credibility of the report;

c) the likelihood of co nfirming the allegation from attributable so urce s.

32 If a Complainant does not wish their identity to be disclosed to the student about whom they are complaining,

the University will endeavour to keep their identity confidential so long as it does not hinder or frustrate any

Investigation. However, the individual making the disclosure may need to provide a statement as part of the

evidence gathering process, and, whilst any written reports will be redacted, their identity may be revealed

or implied as part of the Investigation process.

33 Where a Complainant does not give permission for disclosure of their identity, this may result in the case

being closed as it may be impossible to investigate the case without disclosing or alluding to their identity.

34 If a Complainant makes an allegation that they believe to be true, which is not supported by evidence nor

found to be true by a subsequent Investigation, no further action will be taken and the case will be filed as

having no case to answer. The University will not consider unsubstantiated reports that it regards as

vexatious or malicious. If, however, on the balance of probabilities, it is determined that a Complainant

knowingly raised false or untrue allegations, then the University may consider disciplinary action against the

Complainant themselves under the Student Code of Conduct (Disciplinary Policy).

35 A group of students may use this procedure to make a collective Complaint. A group representative must

be identified wit h whom the University will liaise. All students must give t heir written consent to the

Adjudication Team for this nominated person to act on their behalf.

# **Academic Matters**

36 A Complaint that leads a student to request re-consideration of an Examination Board decision, and which

falls within one of the categories defined within the Academic Appeals Policy, will be considered an Academic

Appeal and not a Complaint - see section 2 of the Academic Appeals Policy.

37 Where the circumstances of a Complaint are found to have impacted adversely on the academic performance

of a student, in line with the University's Academic Appeals Policy, a summary of the findings and their impact

will be passed by the Registrar and University Secretary to the Pro Vice Chancellor Education and Student

Experience, who will take Chair's Actio n in lieu of Stage 2 of the Academic Appeals process.

# **Complaints against Staff**

38 Any Investigation that is conducted under the formal stages of the Student Complaints Policy, and where an

allegation against a member of staff is involved, must be conducted in accordance with principles that ensure

a balance between the interests of the Complainant and those of the member of staff involved. These

principles include the expectation that there will be:

a) an assumption of no fault until the balance of evidence from the Investigation demonstrates otherwise;

b) respect for the dignity of the individuals involved;

c) the right of the member of staff to be told of the Complaint and to know of the evidence presented by

the Co mpla i na nt;

d) the right of the member of staff to respond to the Complaint and the evidence and to be accompanied

by a colleague staff member in any Investigatory meetings or at any stage of the process;

e) the right of the member of staff to know the outcome;

f) the right of the member of staff to have confidentiality preserved where there is any consequential action

involving the employee.

39 Where a Complaint involving an allegation of misconduct by a member of staff is upheld this may form the

basis of further action under the Staff Disciplinary Procedure. Whilst the Complainant has the right to be told

that the appropriate course of action has been followed, details of the outcome will be only disclosed as

deemed appropriate and relevant.

# **Timescales**

40 A Complaint will not normally be investigated if a period of three months has elapsed since the alleged action

that is the basis of the Complaint. The Head of Adjudication may exceptionally allow such a Complaint to

proceed, but the student will need to provide a valid reason, with formal evidence, for not being able to make

a Complaint within the relevant timeframe.

41 At the Informal stage, if a meeting is arranged, the student should receive at least two clear working days’

notice to attend. The written or oral response will be provided to the student within 10 working days of the

Complaint being raised, except where good reason can be demonstrated for requiring a longer period. At

this point, the student has 10 working days from when the Informal Outcome is received to submit a Formal

Complaint. This timeframe may exceptionally be waived where the student has a valid reason, with formal

evidence as to why they were unable to submit the Formal Complaint on time.

42 On receipt of the Formal Complaint, the Adjudication Team will determine whether it is appropriate for the

Complaint to be considered. The student will be informed of their decision within 10 working days of receipt

of the Complaint. If a meeting is arranged to discuss the case, the student should receive at least two clear

working days’ notice to attend.

43 Following Investigation of the Formal Complaint the Investigator will provide a written outcome to the

Adjudication Team w hic h will be communicated to the student within 10 working days, where possible. The

student will also be advised of their right to proceed to a Formal Review Hearing or to request a Completion

of Procedures letter to take their case to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.

44 If the student wishes to take their case to a Review Hearing following the Stage One Outcome, they must

submit a Formal Review Complaint Form to the Adjudication Team within 10 working days of having received

the Outcome of the Formal Investigation. The Adjudication Team will record and acknowledge the request

for a Review, normally within 5 working days of receipt.

45 Where the Registrar and University Secretary determines that there are grounds for a Stage Two Review,

the Vic e-C ha nce llor will nominate a Chair to convene a Student Complaint Review Hearing. All st ude nts a nd

staff who are required to attend the Hearing should be given at least two working days’ notice of the Hearing.

46 All documentation must be submitted by the Complainant to the notetaker not less than 7 working days before

the Hearing. Papers will be circulated to staff members, the Complainant and, where appropriate, the

individuals against whom the Complaint is being made, not less than 5 working days before the Hearing.

47 The outcome of the Hearing will be notified in writing to all concerned by the Registrar and University

Secretary, normally within 10 working days.

# **Investigations and Hearings**

48 The Complaints Policy contains the following stages:

a) Stude nt-led Informal discussion of the Complaint with the individual(s) directly involved.

b) Formal Investigation of the Complaint (Stage One) throug h Ad j udicati o n.

c) Formal Review at a Student Complaint Review Hearing (Stage Two) through Adjudication.

49 Any Investigation that is conducted under the Formal stages of the Student Complaints Policy, and w here an

allegation against a member of staff is involved, must be conducted in accordance with principles that ensure

a balance between the interests of the Complainant and those of the member of staff involved.

50 At the Informal stage, the student should contact the member of staff or Department concerned to raise their

concerns either in writing or as part of a discussion, making clear the matter that they wish to discuss and

the nature of the Complaint that they wish to raise.

51 Under Stage One of the Formal process, the Investigator may need to conduct a meeting with the student,

in which case a note of the meeting will be taken and the student will have the right to representation. Under

Stage Two of the Formal process, the student will be required to attend a Complaint Review Hearing Panel

which will comprise three members of the Executive/Senior Management Team not involved in prior stages

of the Complaint. Non-attendance by any party will normally result in the Hearing continuing in their absence

and therefore being based only on the documentation submitted previously. The student will be required to

submit documentation prior to the Hearing, consisting of the Formal Complaint Form, Supplementary She et,

details of witnesses to be called by the Complainant and the Stage One Investigator, together with a brief

statement giving the purpose of their attendance. The student will be given an opportunity to outline their

Complaint in person at the Hearing.

52 Students are expected to engage with an Investigation Interview and any subsequent Hearing either on

campus or through video-conferencing. It is expected that all cameras will be switched on during a Hearing

unless there is a technical reason why this is not possible. Telephone interviews will only be offered under

exceptional circumstances.

53 The University recognises that students have academic and external commitments and will aim to take

reasonable account of the personal circumstances of students in arranging interviews and meetings but it is

likely that meetings will occur during normal office hours. In the event of a student being unable to attend an

interview or meeting, they must contact the Investigator or Adjudication Team before the proposed time in

order to seek a deferral. The University will normally permit one such deferral at the request of a student.

```
Where a student fails to attend an Interview or Hearing, or seeks to defer the meeting unreasonably, the
University may proceed in their absence.

```

```
54 A record will be made of all Interviews and Hearings described in this Policy. Where an I nformal D isc ussi o n
or Investigation meeting takes place the staff member should keep a written record of the meeting and/or
written correspondence and the Faculty is responsible for providing administrative support for these meetings.
Where a Hearing takes place, a notetaker will be nominated by the Registrar and University Secretary.
Where a meeting takes place through video-conferencing, the Investigator or Provost will ask the student’s
permission to record the session.

```

```
55 At the conclusion of the Formal Review Hearing, the Review Panel will meet in private in order to make its
decision. The outcome of the Hearing will be notified in writing to all concerned by the Registrar and University
Secretary, normally within 10 working days.

```

```
56 Following the Hearing all documentation must be returned to the notetaker to be destroyed and a single
master set of documentation will be retained by the Adjudication Team under safe and secure conditions.

```

# **Witnesses and Representation**

```
57 In co nd ucting the Investigation, the University may invite the Complainant to meet with staff. At all such
meetings, the student can be accompanied by a friend: for example, an officer of the University of
Bedfordshire Students’ Union, a fellow student, a member of academic staff, or a contact from outside the
University, such as a member of the family. The University must be notified of the name and affiliation of the
person concerned in advance of the meeting.

```

```
58 If the Complainant intends bringing someone from outside the University to meetings, they must seek
approval from the University in advance. It is not normally necessary to be accompanied by a legally qualified
person, but if the Complainant wishes to do this, they must first seek approval and, if so, the University
reserves the right to include a legally qualified colleague to also participate in the meeting.

```

```
59 Any accompanying person will not be permitted to present the case on behalf of the student, but will be in
attendance to support and to clarify issues as appropriate.

```

60 It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that any witnesses whom they wish to call in support of their

Complaint are available for the Hearing and are briefed as to the arrangements.

61 It is the expectation of the University that members of University will support the operation of this Policy.

Therefore staff members who are called as witnesses to appear before the Student Complaint Review Panel,

or who are involved at any stage in the investigative process, are required to co- operate fully with the process

whether called on behalf of the University or by the person making the Complaint.

62 In exceptional circumstances a staff member may request permission to be excluded from an Investigation

or to not be required to appear as a witness before the Review Hearing Panel. Where it is the view of the

C hair at the Formal Hearing Panel that the evidence that can be provided by the staff member is more

important to the resolution of the Complaint than the objections of the staff member, then the staff member

will be required to participate in this process. Failure to do so may constitute a disciplinary offence.

63 It is the responsibility of the Registrar and University Secretary, through the Adjudication Team, to ensure

that those witnesses whom the University wishes to call in support of its decision on the Complaint are

available for the Hearing and are briefed as to the arrangements.

# **Mediation**

```
64 At any point prior to the completion of a Formal Review Hearing, a request for mediation can be made by a
Complainant. Mediation will only occur with the agreement of all parties involved, and the formal Complaints

```

# **Procedure will be suspended while mediation takes place.**

```
65 The purpose of mediation is to provide a forum for reaching a decision on, or solution to, a stude nt’s
Complaint, particularly where the Complaint centres on a certain member of staff or a group of staff.

```

```
66 The mediation forum consists of the stude nt and their frie nd, a member of the Stude nts’ Uni o n (additiona l to
the student’s friend), the member of staff w ho is the subject of the Complaint, the member(s) or staff
responsible for the area of the University’s activity that is the subject of the Complaint, a member of staff from

```

```
another School or equivalent, and a Chair appointed by the Vice Chancellor from among the senior staff of
the Uni vers ity not previously involved in the Complaint.

```

67 The mediation procedure may be invoked or rejected by either the stude nt or the University.

68 The key features of the mediation procedure are that it provides a forum for the discussion of key issues

contributing to the case, and that members agree at the outset to abide by the outcomes of the discussion.

# **From the University’s perspective, the outcome of the mediatio n forum concludes the Complaints Procedure.**

# **The Complaints Process**

69 The Complaints Policy contains the following stages:

a) Informal discussion of the Complaint with the individual(s) directly involved, led by the student.

b) Formal Investigation of the Complaint (Stage One).

c) Formal Review at a Student Complaint Review Hearing (Stage Two).

# **Student-Led Informal Discussion**

70 The University expects students to try to resolve their Complaint informally, at a local level, in the first

i nstance. T he stude nt should contact the member(s) of staff or Department(s) concerned to raise their

concerns either in writing or as part of a discussion, making clear the matter that they wish to discuss and

the nature of the Complaint that they wish to raise. If a meeting is arranged, the student should receive at

least two clear working days’ notice to attend. The member(s) of staff conducting the meeting may request

the presence of a colleague and the student may also be accompanied by a fellow student or a representative

of the University of Bedfordshire Students’ Union.

71 The staff member(s) should keep a written record of the meeting and/or written correspondence. The written

or oral response will be provided to the student within 10 working days of the Complaint being raised, except

where good reason can be demonstrated for requiring a longer period.

72 The student will be informed of the outcome of the ir Complaint and if any remedy is proposed. The st ude nt

will also be informed of their right to proceed to the Formal stage of the process should they not be satisfied

with the outcome of the Informal stage.

73 The student should keep a record of how they tried to resolve the issue informally. This will help infor m any

further correspondence or escalation of the matters raised.

74 A record of the circumstances of the Complaint will be retained by the Department(s) or passed to the

Department in the case of a Complaint against a service. This record will indicate either any action to be

taken or the reason for the decision to reject the Complaint. This record will be destroyed when the student

graduates or otherwise ceases to be a student of the University.

75 Schools and services will keep basic details of all Complaints resolved at this level, including details of the

Complainant, the nature of the Complaint and the outcome.

76 The student should make every possible effort to resolve their Complaint w ithi n the rele va nt Department(s)

or Service(s), or in disc ussio n w ith t he Head(s) of the relevant Department or Service. The Formal process

can take some time and should be used only if the steps above ha ve been followed.

# **Formal Investigation – Stage One**

77 Where students are dissatisfied with the outcome of the Informal Discussion, or where the Complaint directly

involves a Head of School/Service or a member of the Senior Management Team and/or where a more in-

depth Investigation is required into the matters raised, a Formal Complaint may be submitted thro ug h the

Adjudication Team.

78 The student has 10 working days from when Informal Outcome is received to submit a Formal Complaint.

This timeframe may exceptionally be waived where the student has a valid reason, with formal evidence as

# **to why they were unable to submit the Formal Complaint on time.**

79 To make a Formal Complaint, the student should complete a Formal Complaint Form (Appendix 1),

accompanied by relevant evidence, and details of the steps the student has taken to resolve the Complaint

informally or their reasons for not doing so, and send it to the Adjudication Team.

80 On receipt of the Formal Complaint, the Adjudication Team will determine w hether it is appropriate for the

Complaint to be considered under this Policy or another Policy. The student will be informed of their decision

within 10 working days of receipt of the Complaint.

81 Where the Adjudication Team finds that the Complaint is appropriate for processing as a Formal Complaint,

they will refer the Complaint to the relevant Head of Department who will investigate the Complaint or appoint

an independent member of staff, who has had no prior direct invo l ve me nt i n the Complaint, to investigate.

The Head of Department will notify the Adjudication Team of the name of the Investigator as soon as

reasonably possible.

82 As part of the Investigation process, the Investigator may need to conduct a meeting with the stude nt, i n

which case a note of the meeting will be taken and the student will have the right to representation (see

Witnesses and Representation). If a meeting is arranged, the student should receive at least two clear

working days’ notice to attend.

83 Following Investigation of the Complaint the Investigator will provide a written outcome to the Adjudication

Team w hic h will be communicated to the st ude nt within 10 working days, where possible, a nd be copied to

the appropriate member(s) of staff concerned, or the person responsible for the matter, which resulted in the

# **Complaint.**

84 The response will indicate whether the Complaint has been **upheld, not upheld or partially upheld** a nd

will, where appropriate, identify any action to be taken as a consequence of the outcome.

85 Where the complaint is not upheld, the student will be notified of their right to proceed to a Formal Complaint

Review Hearing, where the Registrar and University Secretary determi nes that there are grounds.

# **Formal Student Complaint Review Hearing – Stage Two**

86 Students are entitled to seek a Review of the decision concerning their Complaint at a Formal Complaint

Review Hearing, only where:

a) there is evidence that the Formal Investigation did not include in its deliberations all relevant issues, and

any relevant issues identified as not included during the Formal Investigation are material to the decision

and do not constitute a new basis for Complaint;

b) there is evidence that the Formal Investigation was not operated in accordance with University policies.

87 A Formal Review Hearing will be initiated by the student advising the Adjudication Team in writing of their

intention to seek a Review, normally within 10 working days of having received the outcome of the Formal

Investigation of the Complaint at Stage One. The student should include a copy of the Formal Complaint

Form, accompanied by the Supplementary Sheet (Appendix 1a) giving details of what action has been taken

to resolve the Complaint at previous stages and w hy the student remains dissatisfied.

88 The Adjudication Team will record and acknowledge the request for a Review, normally within 5 working

days of receipt, and will inform the Registrar and University Secretary and the Vice-C hancellor of the

Complaint.

89 Where the Registrar and University Secretary determines that there are grounds for a Stage Two Review of

the Stage One Formal Complaint Investigation Outcome, the Vice-Chancellor will nominate a Chair to

convene a Stude nt Complaint Review Hearing.

90 Where the Registrar determines there are no grounds the student will be issued with a Completion of

Procedures Letter and notified of their right to pursue the matter further with the Office of the Independent

Adjudicator for Higher Education.

91 The Complaint Review Hearing Panel will comprise three members of the Corporate Planning Performance

Team not involved in prior stages of the Complaint, one of whom will be nominated by the Vice-C ha ncel lor

to act as Chair. A notetaker will be nominated by the Registrar and University Secretary.

92 All students and staff who are required to attend the Hearing have the right to be accompanied by another

individual (see Witnesses and Representation) and should be given at least two working days’ notice of the

Hearing.

93 Non-attendance by any party will normally result in the Hearing continuing in their absence and therefore

being based only on the documentation submitted previously.

94 Documentation for the Review Hearing should be submitted to those attending, and will normally consist of:

a) the Formal Complaint Form accompanied by Supplementary Sheet submitted by the Complainant;

b) details of witnesses to be called by both the Complainant and the Stage One Investigator, together with

a brief statement giving the purpose of their attendance;

c) any other background documentation.

95 All documentation must be submitted by the Complainant, to the notetaker not less than 7 working days

before the Hearing.
