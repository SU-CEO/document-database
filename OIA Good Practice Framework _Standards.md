1. This is the third edition of the Good Practice Framework: Handling complaints and academic
    
    appeals, published in December 2022. It builds on earlier editions, drawing on good practice
    
    we have identified through our casework and wider work with students, student representative
    
    bodies, and providers. It also draws on the expertise of people in a range of bodies in further and
    
    higher education and in complaints resolution and ombuds bodies who have responded to our
    
    consultation and contributed to the further development of the Framework.
    
2. The membership of our Scheme is large and diverse. Members deliver a range of courses and
    
    qualifications to students, trainees and apprentices, who engage with their learning in a variety
    
    of different formats. In the Framework we use the term “provider” to refer to any member of our
    
    Scheme, and the term “student” to refer to students, trainees and apprentices.
    
3. The Framework is intended to support providers to develop and follow fair processes, and to be
    
    a tool to help any provider to evaluate their own processes. It can also be a useful resource for
    
    students and those who advise them as guidance on what good complaints and appeals processes
    
    should look like.
    
4. The Framework sets out guidance to help providers approach complaints and academic appeals
    
    fairly and make their processes easy to understand and follow. Providers’ policies and procedures
    
    will vary depending on their own academic regulations and broader context, including the size and
    
    make-up of the student body, but should be consistent with the Framework. The Framework informs
    
    how we consider complaints to us.
    
5. The Competition and Markets Authority has indicated that procedures are more likely to comply
    
    with consumer law if they follow guidelines published by the OIA or the Scottish Public Services
    
    Ombudsman. We recommend that each provider, along with its students, compares its own
    
    complaints and academic appeals processes to the Framework to be sure that there are sound
    
    reasons for any differences.
    
6. We have identified ten core principles for the development and operation of effective procedures.

```
Good procedures are:
♦ Accessible and clear
♦ Fair, independent and confidential
♦ Inclusive
♦ Flexible, proportionate and timely,
and they
♦ Improve the student experience.

```

```
These principles underpin the Framework.

```

# **Introduction**

**Good Practice Framework: Handling complaints and academic appealsGood Practice Framework: Handling complaints and academic appeals**

# **What is a complaint?**

1. For the purpose of this Framework, a student complaint is:

```
“an expression of dissatisfaction by one or more students about something a provider has done
or not done, or about the standard of service provided by or on behalf of the provider”.

```

```
Some providers use different terminology, for example referring to “concerns”, “grievances” or
“representations”.

```

1. Examples of issues that students might raise as complaints include:

```
♦ the provider not meeting obligations including those outlined in course/student handbooks or a
student charter
♦ misleading or incorrect information in prospectuses or promotional material and other information
provided by the provider
♦ concerns about the delivery of a programme, teaching or administration including, where
applicable, delivery by a partner provider
♦ poor quality of learning resources or facilities
♦ poor quality services
♦ events causing significant disruption to the normal delivery of a course, service or other aspect of
the student experience, such as industrial action or a public health emergency
♦ bullying or harassment by another student or a staff member (if the provider does not have a
separate procedure for students to raise these kinds of concerns).
♦ concerns about policies or procedures relating to financial support, immigration processes or
welfare support
♦ concerns about a service delivered by other organisations or contractors on behalf of the provider
that the student feels has affected their learning experience.

```

1. Examples of issues that are not normally handled as complaints include:

```
♦ a concern about a decision made by an academic body regarding student progression, academic
assessment and awards, which would normally be considered under the academic appeals
process.
♦ a concern raised by a student about the outcome of their own disciplinary process. (At the end of
any appeal process, the student could complain to us .)
♦ a concern about a decision made under other specific regulations, such as fitness to practise. (At
the end of any appeal process, the student could complain to us .)
♦ matters relating to the Student Loans Company, which has its own complaints procedures.

```

1. A student complaint will usually be about something that has a direct impact on the person making
    
    the complaint. Where a student has a more general concern about policies or actions of a provider,
    
    there may be other ways to raise the matter. For example, a student representative body might
    
    routinely discuss concerns raised by individual students with senior leaders on behalf of the whole
    
    student body.
    
2. It is good practice to allow students to raise any issue as a complaint where there are no other formal
    
    processes for the student to get a response to their concern.
    
3. For the purposes of this Framework an academic appeal is defined as:

```
“a challenge to or request for reconsideration of a decision by an academic body that makes
decisions on student progress, assessment and awards This may include a request to change
marks or progress decisions, or final award classifications .”

```

1. An academic appeal relates to the outcome of an assessment or exam, or a student’s progression,and may be based on:

```
♦ a procedural irregularity in the assessment process
♦ bias or reasonable perception of bias
♦ circumstances affecting the student’s performance where, for good reason, the academic body
was not made aware of a significant factor relating to the assessment of a student when it made
its original decision
♦ a challenge to the outcome of a student’s request for additional consideration of personal
circumstances which have affected their performance (if the provider’s procedures for responding
to requests for additional consideration don’t include an appeal stage).

```

1. Most providers’ academic appeal procedures don’t allow students to question the exercise of
    
    academic judgment, that is, a decision made by academic staff on the quality of the work itself or the
    
    criteria being applied to mark the work (rather than the administrative marking process).
    
2. The provider needs to set out clearly what its academic appeals process covers and the grounds on
    
    which a student can make an academic appeal.
    
3. Students have the right to appeal the outcome of other internal procedures such as disciplinary and
    
    fitness to practise processes. To avoid confusion, it is good practice for those procedures to include
    
    a separate appeal route, rather than using the academic appeal process.
    
4. When a student complains to us at the end of the higher education provider’s internal processes, we
    
    refer to it as a complaint whichever internal process the student has followed. This is in line with the
    
    language of the Higher Education Act 2004.
    

# **What is an academic appeal?**

1. A provider’s complaints and academic appeals procedures are for its students. The term “student”
    
    refers to students, trainees or apprentices who have registered or enrolled on their course. It
    
    also includes those who have recently left a provider. It is good practice for providers to set out
    
    a deadline for students to raise complaints or make appeals, once they are no longer a student.
    
    Providers should apply the deadline flexibly, and be willing to consider whether any former student
    
    has a good reason for making their complaint or appeal after this time.
    
2. Students should have confidence that they won’t be disadvantaged by making a complaint and it
    
    should not be necessary to make a complaint anonymously. A provider may decide to consider
    
    an anonymous complaint if there are good reasons for the matter to be investigated, for example
    
    because the complaint raises safeguarding issues, or issues that may affect a number of students
    
    or a whole department or course. Providers should explain to all students that raising a concern
    
    anonymously might change the way that the provider can investigate the issue, and limit how it can
    
    respond to and support the students concerned. For example, a provider will not usually be able to
    
    issue a Completion of Procedures Letter if it doesn’t know who made the complaint, so the student
    
    might not be able to bring their complaint to us. Providers should explain to students that complaints
    
    that are not anonymous are still treated confidentially as far as possible.
    
3. To bring a complaint to the OIA a student must be or have been a registered student at a provider
    
    that is a member of our Scheme. Providers may have separate processes for applicants to make a
    
    complaint or to challenge decisions about who to admit to a course. Providers may choose to apply
    
    the principles in this Framework to those processes, but people who are only applicants and are not
    
    registered students may not bring a complaint to us at the end of those processes.
    
4. Similarly, providers may have separate complaints processes to address matters raised by members
    
    of the public or members of staff, but only students can complain to the OIA.
    
5. Many providers deliver courses that result in awards across the full range of levels within the UK
    
    Frameworks for HE Qualifications. It is good practice to provide students with a route of complaint
    
    or appeal regardless of their level of study. It is important that providers direct students to the right
    
    process for their level and type of study and direct them to the OIA when relevant.
    

# **Who can make a complaint or academic appeal?**

1. Students will usually be able to make a complaint or academic appeal themselves. However, there
    
    may be cases where a student is unable or reluctant to make a complaint or academic appeal
    
    without support. It is reasonable for providers not to accept complaints from third parties unless they
    
    are acting as a student’s representative. It is usually appropriate to ask the student to confirm their
    
    agreement before accepting a complaint or appeal from a third party on their behalf.
    
2. It is good practice for the provider’s regulations to permit students to be supported, advised or
    
    represented by third parties, for example an officer or adviser from a student representative body. If a
    
    student has a representative, that should not delay the process.
    
3. The provider may give examples of who can, or can’t, act as a supporter or representative for the
    
    student and explain what their role in the process will usually be. However, the provider will need
    
    to apply its normal policy flexibly, for example to make reasonable adjustments, or because it may
    
    disadvantage the student if the requirements were applied rigidly.
    
4. Providers’ internal complaints and appeals procedures do not have the same level of formality as
    
    a court of law. In most cases it will not be necessary, appropriate or helpful for a student or the
    
    provider to be legally represented during a complaint. Legal representation at an academic appeal
    
    hearing would only be appropriate in very exceptional circumstances. The involvement of a legal
    
    representative has potential to change the nature of the procedure or delay the process. But where
    
    a student asks to use a legal representative, the provider should carefully consider whether it would
    
    be reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case to allow them to do so. It is not good
    
    practice to ban students from using legal representation entirely.
    
5. Providers do not normally have an obligation to contribute towards the costs of a student’s legal or
    
    other representation. However, it may be appropriate for providers to consider doing so where some
    
    form of representation is necessary to prevent a disadvantage to a disabled student. This is because
    
    the provider must make its procedures accessible. Students should not be expected to use personal
    
    support resources intended for their academic work, funded by Disabled Students’ Allowance, on
    
    complaints or appeals.
    

```
Case study 1: Provider contributing to the cost of a student’s representation
An autistic student complains to their provider about access to specialist equipment in a laboratory
and their interactions with the module lead. The student finds it difficult to articulate their complaint
and the thought of a meeting to discuss the complaint is overwhelming. A student adviser at
the provider’s student representative body helps the student to complete the complaint form
and supports them through the initial process. The student has previously had help from an
organisation that supports autistic adults in navigating formal processes such as employment
or housing disputes. The student would like to use this support again. The provider agrees to
contribute to the cost of a representative with experience in supporting autistic adults to attend the
complaint meeting with the student.

```

# **Representation**

# **Support**

1. Students are often inexperienced in raising concerns independently, within formal structures. They
    
    may not have had positive experiences of other bodies with authority over other aspects of their lives.
    
    They may anticipate that the process will be confrontational, and be worried about how staff may react
    
    to them raising their concerns and that it might have negative effects on their studies and career. It
    
    is important that providers take steps to give reassurance on these points. For example, providers
    
    can explain how marking and moderation procedures usually operate, ensuring that a member of
    
    staff can’t reduce a student’s grades because they had made a complaint. Providers can encourage
    
    a culture of listening to feedback and share with students the actions they have taken to respond
    
    to students’ concerns. If the complaints process is part of this wider positive culture it can be less
    
    intimidating.
    
2. Students may be concerned that bringing a complaint that is not upheld may result in action against
    
    them under conduct, disciplinary or fitness to practise procedures. It is important to assure students
    
    that they will not be penalised for raising a complaint about something they are genuinely concerned
    
    about, even if those concerns turn out to be misplaced.
    
3. It is good practice to make sure students have access to well-resourced sources of advice and
    
    guidance. Often this support will be based within the provider’s own student representative body, or
    
    within another student representative body that the provider’s students have access to. Where there is
    
    no student representative body, providers should make sure that staff members who are independent
    
    of the subject of the complaint or appeal can give students advice and guidance about the process.
    
4. Some support services are able to offer advocacy services which might include helping a student
    
    prepare written submissions, attending hearings and speaking on the student’s behalf. Other services
    
    are more targeted towards enabling the student to act independently. However the service is
    
    structured, it can be helpful to explore these issues with the student:
    
    ♦ How does the process work? What will the student need to do, what deadlines will they need to
    
    meet, and how long is the process likely to take?
    
    ♦ What evidence can the student supply to support their views? Who can supply this?
    
    ♦ What outcome does the student want? Is this realistic?
    
    ♦ What can the student do while the case is ongoing to put themselves in the best position for
    
    afterwards? It can be helpful to think about what will happen if the student’s case is successful, and
    
    also what will happen if it is not successful. This is particularly important if there could be an impact
    
    on opportunities to repeat assessments or continue to engage with specialist learning opportunities
    
    like placements.
    
    ♦ Are there wider issues that have been raised that the student needs support with? For example,
    
    has an academic decision had an impact on the student’s financial entitlements, arrangements for
    
    accommodation or visa status? It may be appropriate to direct students towards specialist sources
    
    of advice in these areas.
    
    ♦ Does the student need support with their mental or physical wellbeing? It may be appropriate to
    
    direct students to additional sources of support.
    

# **The process**

# **Overview**

1. Providers should have separate complaints and academic appeals procedures. It is good practice for
    
    these procedures to include:
    
    ♦ opportunity for early resolution at a local level
    
    ♦ a formal stage for investigating and deciding complaints or appeals
    
    ♦ a review stage.
    
2. **Early resolution** is designed to address straightforward concerns quickly and locally, for example
    
    at school or faculty level, before a student makes a formal complaint or appeal. This might include,
    
    for example, face-to-face discussion with the student to explain a decision, or asking an appropriate
    
    member of staff, or mediator or conciliator, to handle the matter. Where proportionate the provider
    
    should write to the student setting out the outcome.
    
3. **The formal stage** is used where a student is dissatisfied with the outcome of early resolution, or
    
    where early resolution is not possible or suitable due to the nature, complexity or seriousness of
    
    the case. The formal stage should normally be handled by people who have not been involved
    
    previously, and (in complaints) may include mediation or conciliation where appropriate. The provider
    
    should write to the student setting out the outcome at the conclusion of this stage.
    
4. **The review stage** is where the student can appeal to a higher level within the provider for a review
    
    of the process of the formal stage to make sure that appropriate procedures were followed and that
    
    the decision was reasonable. The issues themselves don’t necessarily need to be reconsidered at
    
    this stage. The provider should write to the student setting out its decision at the conclusion of this
    
    stage.
    

# **Timeliness**

1. Each provider has its own timelines and deadlines for the formal and review stages. It is good
    
    practice for providers to complete consideration of a formal complaint or academic appeal and any
    
    associated review within 90 calendar days. The 90-calendar day timeframe requires students to
    
    meet any deadlines set by the provider for submitting information or evidence.
    
2. There will occasionally be circumstances when, for good reason, the provider will need to extend
    
    the timeframe. Where this is the case the provider should tell the student and update them regularly
    
    on progress. It is important to think about any reasons why a student’s complaint or appeal might be
    
    urgent, and to remember that the urgency of an issue may change in response to external factors
    
    such as progression points.
    
3. It is good practice to give students information about any actions they need to take to preserve their
    
    position while the issues are still being considered (for example, to make sure they don’t miss any
    
    course deadlines or a resit opportunity) and to direct students to any sources of advice.
    
4. It is good practice for procedures to set time limits for making complaints and academic appeals,
    
    and for these time limits to be clearly communicated to students. It is also good practice to direct
    
    students to the relevant time limits for the next stage in the process when telling them the decision at
    
    each stage.
    
5. When setting deadlines, the provider will need to make sure a student or former student has a
    
    reasonable period to bring their complaint or appeal and seek support or advice if they wish to.
    
    But it can be challenging to investigate or respond to complaints or appeals that are made a long
    
    time after the issues arose, for example because key individuals may have moved on or important
    
    records may no be longer available. When deciding whether to accept a late complaint or appeal the
    
    provider needs to consider the student’s individual circumstances, the nature and seriousness of the
    
    issues they are raising, and whether it is still reasonably possible to investigate the events.
    
6. Providers should apply deadlines flexibly when the student has a good reason, which should
    
    normally be supported by evidence, for making their complaint or academic appeal late. It is good
    
    practice for a provider to keep a record of why it has accepted a complaint or appeal late.
    
7. Providers should always think about their obligations under the equalities legislation when
    
    considering whether there are exceptional reasons to accept a complaint or academic appeal
    
    outside the normal time limit, or whether it would be reasonable to make adjustments to the
    
    provider’s normal procedures. Where the provider knows a student is disabled, it will not normally be
    
    appropriate to ask the student for evidence of this again when they are asking for an adjustment to
    
    the process. The provider should explore with the student what adjustments they might reasonably
    
    need. The provider should get advice from its disability support team where appropriate.
