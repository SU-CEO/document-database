# OIA Good Practice Framework Case Studies 11 onwards

# **Case study 11: Considering connected issues under separate processes**

```
A final year student makes an academic appeal against their degree classification on the ground
that they had personal circumstances that affected their performance, and there was a good
reason why the circumstances could not be made known to the exam board at the time. The
student explains they felt very unwell on the day they had to sit an exam that was weighted at 50%
of the module mark, and they believe this affected their performance in the assessment. They
provide evidence of both their illness and their reasons for not making the board aware of their
circumstances at the time.
The student also says that in previous years the module was assessed by two equally weighted
essays, but they didn’t find out about the changes to the assessment methods until after the
module had started. The student explains they wouldn’t have chosen the module if they’d
known in advance they would need to sit an exam because they have anxiety which is brought
on by exams. The student says that worrying about the exam ruined the final semester of their
programme for them.

```

```
The provider carries out an initial assessment of the appeal and decides the information and
evidence the student has provided about their illness meet its grounds for appeal and should be
referred to an appeal panel for further consideration. The provider decides the other issues don’t
fall within the scope of its appeals procedure, but it tells the student they can make a complaint
about the way the changes to assessment methods were communicated if they want to, and how
to do that. The student makes a complaint and receives separate outcomes for their appeal and
complaint.

# **Complaints and appeals involving**

# **more than one academic provider**

# **or awarding body**

1. Guidance on handling complaints and academic appeals involving more than one provider orawarding body can be found in the Good Practice Framework: Delivering learning opportunities withothers.

# **Complaints involving other**

# **organisations or contractors who**

# **provide a service on behalf of the**

# **provider**

1. A student may wish to complain about the service provided by another organisation (which is not a
    
    higher education provider) on behalf of the higher education provider, for example accommodation
    
    services or leisure facilities. It is good practice to explain to students whether, and in what
    
    circumstances, the student can complain to the provider about those services, and how to complain
    
    to the other organisation. Providers should make sure that these organisations have appropriate
    
    complaints procedures in place.
    
2. Students should be able to complain directly to the provider about a service provided by another
    
    organisation, for example, a placement provider, which the student feels has impacted on their
    
    learning experience.
    
3. If a provider needs to make enquiries to an outside organisation when investigating a complaint,
    
    it should take care to comply with data protection legislation and the provider’s own policies on
    
    handling personal information.
    

# **Complaints about a student representative body**

1. The nature of the relationship between the provider and the students’ union or student
    
    representative body varies between providers. It is important to explain to students how they can
    
    raise complaints about the actions of their student representative body.
    
2. Some providers are obliged by law to make sure that there is a complaints procedure available to
    
    individual students and groups of students who want to complain about their students’ union. The
    
    students’ union procedures must include provision for an independent person appointed by the
    
    provider’s governing body to investigate and report on complaints. (Section 22 of the Education Act
    
    1994 sets out the responsibilities of universities for their students’ unions).
    
3. All providers should make sure that complaints about the students’ union or other student
    
    representative body are handled fairly and promptly and that an effective remedy is provided when a
    
    complaint is upheld.
    
4. If a student who has made a complaint or academic appeal is in dispute with the student
    
    representative body, either about that issue or about something else, it is good practice for the
    
    provider to direct the student to other sources of support.
    
5. Where a student complains to the provider about the student representative body, it is good practice
    
    to explain what the provider’s role is and what it can and can’t do, particularly if the student is
    
    seeking a remedy that the provider can’t deliver.
    
6. Generally, we can’t look at complaints about the actions of an independent student representative
    
    body. However, we can consider a complaint about a student representative body where it is part
    
    of the legal entity of the higher education provider, or where the complaint concerns the provider’s
    
    obligations relating to its student representative body. Where a provider has considered a complaint
    
    about a student representative body it should give the student a Completion of Procedures Letter at
    
    the end of that process.
    

# **Case study 12: Late submission - waiting for advice from the students’ union**

```
A student makes an academic appeal about their end of year results. The student explains that
they have missed the deadline to send in their appeal because they were waiting for advice from
the students’ union. They provide evidence that shows the students’ union promised to get back to
them and had told the student that the deadline was not important. The provider decides to accept
the appeal and advises the student how they can make a complaint to the students’ union.

```

# **Complaints about the behaviour of staff or other students**

1. Providers should have procedures in place for handling complaints from students about other
    
    students or members of staff. Providers may choose to design specific processes to address
    
    students’ concerns about the behaviour of another member of the provider’s community. For
    
    example, many providers have developed bullying and harassment or dignity at work and study
    
    procedures. If the provider does not have a separate procedure for students to raise these kinds
    
    of concerns, then students should be allowed to raise concerns about behaviour under the general
    
    student complaints procedure.
    
2. Some providers have processes in place that allow students to report concerns about the behaviour
    
    of other people anonymously. It is good practice to explain clearly whether and how the provider’s
    
    response to anonymous reporting is different to how it can respond to complaints that are not
    
    anonymous.
    
3. When students complain about staff members it is essential that the investigation is conducted by
    
    someone who is independent of the situation to avoid bias or a reasonable perception of bias. It
    
    is important to make sure that there are proper procedures in place that set out the process for
    
    handling such complaints. The provider may need to investigate or take action under its staff human
    
    resources (HR) procedures. However, it may be possible to draw a distinction between a complaint
    
    about alleged misconduct of a member of staff that should normally be handled under an HR
    
    procedure, and what is effectively a service complaint directed at an individual member of staff that
    
    can be handled under the complaints procedure.
    
4. It is reasonable for providers to expect students to take steps to resolve some disagreements and
    
    disputes with other students themselves. For example, it would be unusual for a provider to become
    
    involved in disagreements about social activities, or cleaning arrangements among students in a
    
    privately rented house. But providers should be alert to students reporting concerns which show a
    
    pattern of behaviour that could amount to bullying or harassment, wherever this behaviour occurs.
    
5. Some complaints of this nature can be successfully resolved informally, or through mediation or
    
    conciliation, for example, where an individual is unaware of the impact of their actions on another
    
    student. But in some instances, it will not be appropriate to try to resolve a complaint informally. The
    
    views of the student reporting the concern should be given significant weight in deciding whether to
    
    attempt informal resolution.
    
6. Where a student’s complaint indicates that another student or member of staff may have breached
    
    expected standards of behaviour, codes of conduct, or expectations or conditions of their
    
    employment, providers will need to investigate the concerns in a way that takes account of the rights
    
    of the person complained about to have a fair process. The Good Practice Framework: Disciplinary
    
    procedures gives guidance relating to students.
    
7. When a student has complained to their provider about the behaviour of another student, the
    
    provider has the same duties and obligations to each of the students involved. Providers should
    
    take all reasonable steps to make sure that they treat each student fairly and should support both
    

```
students through the process. It is good practice to identify separate members of staff to act as
sources of support and advice for the students.

```

1. It is good practice to explain to reporting students how they will be involved in the process of
    
    investigating the complaint. The extent of their involvement will depend on the unique circumstances
    
    of the case and should take account of the provider’s responsibilities relating to safeguarding,
    
    data protection, and employment law as well as the views of the individuals involved. Providers
    
    should explain whether, when and how the reporting student will have opportunities to make
    
    further statements or respond to evidence gathered. It is good practice to explain whether the
    
    reporting student may attend all or part of a hearing, and how their evidence will be shared with the
    
    responding person and with decision-makers. It is not usually good practice to allow reporting and
    
    responding parties to cross examine one another directly in hearings.
    
2. Data protection legislation does not completely prevent providers sharing information about a
    
    responding person’s disciplinary process with the reporting student. There are benefits to the
    
    reporting student, and to the student community as a whole, in being open about how complaints
    
    about student or staff behaviour have been considered.
    
3. Nevertheless, providers must think carefully about individuals’ rights to privacy. It is good practice to
    
    document reasons for deciding what information can or can’t be shared.
    
4. Whether the complaint is handled under the complaints procedure or referred to a separate
    
    procedure for the allegations to be investigated, the student who made the complaint should
    
    receive a resolution to that complaint. It is good practice to consider including at least the following
    
    information:
    
    ♦ What steps were taken to investigate the complaint;
    
    ♦ A summary or high-level description of the evidence made available to the decision-maker(s), or a
    
    copy of that evidence;
    
    ♦ Who made the decision(s);
    
    ♦ What measures may be put in place to prevent the issue that led to the complaint happening
    
    again;
    
    ♦ If the behaviour is found to have had an adverse impact on the reporting student, a remedy for
    
    that impact.
    
5. Providers should set out clearly whether and how a student can challenge the outcome of their
    
    complaint about the behaviour of another student or member of staff. It is unusual to allow a
    
    reporting student to make an appeal that directly challenges the penalty applied to another student
    
    or member of staff through a disciplinary procedure. But it is good practice to allow students to ask
    
    for a review of the outcome of their complaint. Typical grounds for requesting a review might include:
    
    ♦ Concerns about the fairness of the procedures followed at the formal stage, including bias or a
    
    reasonable perception of bias;
    
    ♦ Concerns about whether the actions taken to support the reporting student going forward are
    
    reasonable;
    
    ♦ New evidence that could make a difference to the outcome and that the student could not
    
    reasonably have provided earlier in the process.
    

# **requesting a review of the outcome Case study 13: Complaint about the behaviour of another student -**

```
a review of the outcome
Student A complains about the behaviour of student B. The provider investigates the complaint
and decides to take action against student B under its disciplinary procedures. Student B is found
to have breached the provider’s code of conduct. The provider tells student A it has upheld their
complaint and has reached a conclusion on the disciplinary case. It explains that student B is
not permitted to contact them and that arrangements have been made so students A and B do
not come into contact in the library. The provider tells student A they can ask for a review of the
outcome of their complaint. Student A asks for a review. They explain the proposed arrangement
giving each student access to the library within certain hours is very difficult for them because they
have caring responsibilities. The provider agrees to amend the arrangements.

```

# **Group complaints**

1. Providers should allow students to complain as a group where the issues raised affect more than
    
    one student. Group cases are most likely to relate to a service or facility delivered by the provider,
    
    and will often involve students studying on a particular module, course or pathway, that use the same
    
    facilities. But students on very different courses of study may also make group complaints where they
    
    share a source of dissatisfaction with their experience, for example, if they are affected by a closure
    
    of leisure or support facilities.
    
2. A provider should consider whether its complaints procedure is flexible enough to allow it to
    
    handle complaints from groups of students in an effective and efficient way, or whether it would be
    
    beneficial to introduce a separate process setting out how it will handle group complaints. Providers
    
    may wish to set out how they will look at complaints from very large groups of students. Any separate
    
    process should reflect the principles and good practice guidance set out in this section of the Good
    
    Practice Framework.
    

# **Deciding whether to treat the case as a group or individual complaints**

1. Students may have a number of well-established routes to raise initial concerns collectively,
    
    particularly where the issue complained about relates to an aspect of their academic experience.
    
    For example, students may raise issues through student academic representatives or course
    
    representatives, or may have opportunities to offer feedback during or at the end of a module.
    
    Students may also approach members of staff directly or start a petition. It is important that providers
    
    explain to students the limits of any actions arising from these processes, and direct students to a
    
    formal complaints process when appropriate.
    
2. Sometimes students will make a formal complaint having already identified themselves as a group. It
    
    is good practice to operate procedures in a way that reduces the administrative burden on students
    
    and staff, for example, not requiring every student in a group to make individual submissions to
    
    initiate the process. But a provider can take reasonable measures to check that any students named
    
    in a group complaint are aware of the complaint and have actively agreed to be part of it.
    

# **Case study 14: Making a group complaint**

```
A provider receives a complaint from the representative of a group of students naming 50 other
students in their cohort as signatories to the complaint. Instead of requiring everyone to submit an
individual complaint form, the provider asks the representative to circulate a copy of the complaint
form to the group. It explains that each student who wants to be part of the group complaint should
send an email from their own student account to the complaints team confirming their student
number, that they are aware of the content of the complaint and that they accept the declaration of
consent on the back of the complaint form.

```

1. It is normally reasonable to expect students to follow any steps set out in the procedure for making
    
    a group complaint and to require students to opt-in to the complaint. Providers don’t have to notify
    
    students that a group complaint has been submitted or encourage them to join it. But it will often
    
    be easier to manage a complaint if the provider tries to establish at an early stage whether other
    
    students have also been affected by the issues and are likely to be joining the group. The students’
    
    union or other student representatives might be able to offer students support in organising the
    
    group even if they are unable to act as the representative for the complaint.
    
2. Sometimes, students may want to join a complaint that is already being investigated, or submit
    
    individual complaints about the same issues after the provider has made its decision. If their
    
    complaint would otherwise be in time under the provider’s procedures, it would not be reasonable to
    
    refuse to look at it because the student wasn’t part of the group from the start. The provider should
    
    explain, or should ask the group’s representative to explain, how far the complaint has got and
    
    whether the student has an opportunity to make individual representations, if they choose to join the
    
    existing group.
    
3. If a provider receives a number of individual complaints about the same issues, it may decide to
    
    handle those complaints as a group. But there should be an element of student choice. If a student
    
    doesn’t want to join the group, or they want to represent themselves in the complaint, they should be
    
    able to make an individual complaint.
    
4. Sometimes students will bring a complaint as a group, but the issues may have impacted the
    
    students in different ways. In circumstances like this the provider may decide to split the complaint
    
    into sub-groups, for example by organising them into different module or programme groups. The
    
    provider may also decide it would be better to handle some of the complaints individually, or to look
    
    at remedies individually. For example, an individual student may have been impacted very differently
    
    because of a disability or personal circumstances. Or they may give the provider information
    
    that they would like to be considered but not shared with other students in the group. It may be
    
    reasonable for the provider to reach a decision about the group complaint first, and then respond to
    
    individual complaints.
    
5. The provider can decide it would be pragmatic to allocate any individual complaints to the same
    
    investigator and decision-makers, so the core issues of complaint only need to be investigated once
    
    and decisions can be made consistently. The investigator’s conclusions on the group complaint
    
    can feed into outcomes for the sub-groups and any individual complaints, although they may have
    
    different outcomes depending on the impact of the issues and the individual circumstances.
    

# **Communicating with the group**

1. Usually it is helpful for someone to act as a representative for the whole group of students making
    
    the complaint. Providers can ask the group to nominate a representative, who will normally be
    
    responsible for liaising with the provider on behalf of the other students. It is helpful for providers to
    
    set out information about the role of the group representative in the process.
    
2. Usually a group representative will need to:

```
♦ Collect and submit information and evidence from the students, making sure it represents all of
the views expressed, not just their own;
♦ Liaise with the provider about the process to be followed and explain this to the group;
♦ Attend any meetings, discussions or hearings and make representations on behalf of the group;

```

```
♦ Present any resolution offered by the provider to the group;
♦ Accept or reject any solutions offered on behalf of the group.

```

1. If the group is large the provider may need to be flexible and extend any deadlines in the procedure
    
    to give the representative enough time to coordinate the views of the rest of the group. It should also
    
    consider allowing the students to nominate more than one representative to help share the work,
    
    although it may ask one of them to act as a lead representative and its primary point of contact. The
    
    provider should consider speaking with the representative(s) at an early stage to make sure they
    
    understand their role and know who to contact if they have any questions about the process.
    
2. If the students are not able to identify their own representative, the provider may consider whether
    
    a member of staff not otherwise involved in the complaint could help the students in this way.
    
    For group complaints the provider needs to make sure that students in the group have a proper
    
    opportunity to put forward their case whether or not there is a representative.
    

# **Responding to the complaint**

1. Responding to a complaint brought by a group of students is broadly the same as responding toa complaint brought by an individual. As with any complaint, it’s important to focus on properlyunderstanding and addressing the students’ concerns, gathering and testing relevant evidence,and where appropriate exploring steps that can be taken to put things right, as early in the processas possible. However, handling a group complaint may need more flexibility. Providers shouldn’toverlook opportunities for early resolution, or mediation or conciliation, just because students havedecided to bring a complaint as a group.

# **Putting things right**

1. Where an offer to put things right is made in the context of a group complaint, it’s important that the
    
    terms of the offer are made clear to the group. The provider should think carefully about whether it
    
    is reasonable to make any offer conditional on the whole group accepting it. In most circumstances,
    
    conditions like this shouldn’t be necessary and students should be able to decide on an individual
    
    basis whether any offer provides a satisfactory resolution for them, or if they want to go on to the
    
    next stage of the provider’s internal procedures or complain to us. Occasionally a remedy might
    
    be difficult to implement unless most students are willing to agree to it. For example, a change to a
    
    module assessment may be impractical to make if only some of the students were to agree to it.
    
2. In some circumstances a provider may consider making an offer to or taking some action for students
    
    who were not part of the group complaint.
    
3. Some of the group may accept an offer at the formal stage and decide not to go to the review stage.
    
    But sometimes the review stage will result in a different or better offer for the remaining students.
    
    Although it doesn’t automatically need to extend the new offer to the other students, the provider
    
    should nevertheless think about whether it would be reasonable in the circumstances to do that. This
    
    is likely to depend on the nature of the complaint and what the conclusions were. For example, if the
    
    review stage concludes that the provider has done something substantially wrong, and that wasn’t
    
    properly acknowledged at the previous stage, the provider still needs to think about how to put that
    
    right for the students. The provider should also consider whether the remedy should be offered to
    
    other affected students too, even if they didn’t join the complaint.
    

# **Case study 15: Group complaint - enhanced offer at the review stage**

```
A group of 25 students complained to the provider about delays in their department releasing
information about placements for the following year. At the formal stage of its procedures, the
provider offered the group compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused by the
delays. 10 students accepted the offer and the remaining 15 decided to take the complaint to
the review stage. At the review stage the provider upheld the findings of the formal stage but
increased the financial offer. The provider decided not to offer the other students the higher
amount because the earlier offer was clear and the students could have asked for a review if they
were unhappy with the amount.

```

# **Case study 16: Group complaint - offering the remedy to all students**

```
A group of 15 students complained to their provider that they hadn’t received tuition on a piece of
specialist software that was essential to their module. At the formal stage the provider explained
that the person with the relevant expertise had left and the provider hadn’t been able to recruit a
replacement in time. It explained it had already changed the module assessments so the students
wouldn’t be disadvantaged academically. It did not uphold the complaint. 10 students in the group
took the complaint to the review stage. At the review stage the provider acknowledged that it
had not delivered something that it had promised in its promotional material and that this hadn’t
properly been addressed at the formal stage. It apologised and offered to bring in an external
expert to deliver a one-day workshop on the specialist software. It extended the apology to all
students on the module and invited all students to attend the workshop, not just those that brought
the complaint.

```

1. It may be appropriate for the provider to recognise, in any remedy offered for a complaint, theadditional responsibilities taken on by students acting as representatives for large groups.

# **Group academic appeals**

1. Group academic appeals are more unusual than group complaints. Normally a provider wouldconsider any circumstances that have had an impact on the performance of multiple students at orbefore the meeting of the relevant assessment board. But the provider should be flexible and allowstudents who have been affected by the same issues in a similar way to submit a group appeal.Guidance on communicating with the group and responding to their concerns applies to appeals aswell as complaints.

# **Completion of Procedures Letters**

1. Once the provider has made its final decision on the group complaint or appeal, it should issueCompletion of Procedure Letters to the students involved in line with our published guidance. Evenif the provider has been corresponding with a representative, it is still responsible for ensuring thateach student is given a copy of the Completion of Procedures Letter setting out its final decision onthe complaint and signposting them to the OIA at the end of the process.

# **Other factors for providers**

# **to consider when handling**

# **complaints and academic appeals**

# **Maintaining confidentiality**

1. Complaints and academic appeals should be handled with an appropriate level of confidentiality,
    
    with information shared only with those who need it for the purposes of investigating or responding
    
    to the complaint or academic appeal. No-one should be told any more about the investigation than
    
    is strictly necessary to get information required from them. It is good practice to remind people
    
    involved in the investigation or review of complaints and appeals that there is an expectation of
    
    confidentiality, and that they should not share the information.
    
2. Students can ask for their complaint or academic appeal or elements of it (for example, a statement
    
    from a witness or medical evidence) to be kept confidential. Providers will need to balance
    
    individuals’ requests for confidentiality against the needs of the investigation. It is good practice
    
    for procedures to set out the circumstances in which the entire complaint or academic appeal – or
    
    elements of it – can be kept confidential, and to explain that this might make it difficult to investigate
    
    properly or to resolve the student’s issues. It may be possible to limit the number of people
    
    information is shared with or to summarise or anonymise it.
    
3. It’s important that decisions are made consistently especially in the context of academic appeals, and
    
    providers should have systems in place to allow decision makers to share information about cases
    
    anonymously.
    

# **Case study 17: Keeping elements of an appeal confidential**

```
A student makes an academic appeal based on very sensitive personal circumstances. The
information is shared only with the Chair of the Exam Board. The Chair is satisfied that the student
has good reason for not disclosing the circumstances earlier. The Chair explains to the rest of the
appeal panel that the student’s circumstances were severe and applied at a particular time. The
appeal panel then considers the student’s academic profile without needing to see details about
the circumstances they had faced.

```

1. Sometimes students share information during a complaint or appeal process that may be relevant
    
    to supporting their continued studies, such as information about a disability. It is good practice to
    
    discuss with the student whether and how this information should be shared within the provider.
    
2. It is not good practice to ask a student to sign a confidentiality agreement or non-disclosure
    
    agreement as a part of an offer to settle or resolve their complaint. Such agreements can leave the
    
    student feeling that their complaint has not been listened to or taken seriously, and can mean that
    
    learning from the complaint is lost.
    

# **Expectations of behaviour**

1. Some people may have difficulties in expressing themselves or communicating clearly, especially
    
    when anxious or upset. Some may find it difficult to identify what impact their behaviour might have
    
    on other people. It is good practice to consider making adjustments to complaints and appeals
    
    processes to support students in accessing them. But it is also important for providers to provide
    
    a safe working environment for their staff and to take account of the negative effect that some
    
    behaviour can have on them and their work.
    
2. It is good practice for providers to have in place policies and procedures setting out:

```
♦ the expectation that students, their representatives and staff members should act reasonably and
fairly towards each other, and treat the processes themselves with respect;
♦ that the provider has a responsibility to protect its staff against behaviour that might have a
negative effect on them or their work;
♦ whether and how concerns about a student’s behaviour might be considered under separate
disciplinary, fitness to practise or support for study procedures.

```

1. These policies and procedures will set out examples of behaviour that may negatively affect staffor their work and the circumstances when the provider may decide to restrict access to staff orprocedures or take other action. The provider should explain to the student any decision to restrictaccess, and the procedures for reviewing such a decision.

# **Complaints and academic appeals that are intended to disrupt or with no serious purpose**

1. It is good practice for providers to have their own policies for dealing with complaints or academic
    
    appeals that have no serious purpose or that are intended to cause disruption or annoyance.
    
    Examples include complaints and academic appeals:
    
    ♦ that the provider has previously considered and decided;
    
    ♦ that are about something which a fair-minded person would consider to be trivial;
    
    ♦ that the student is pursuing in a way that is having a seriously negative effect on the provider’s
    
    staff or work;
    
    ♦ where the student is looking for a remedy that lacks any serious purpose or value.
    
2. The provider may decide to terminate consideration of a complaint or academic appeal under this
    
    policy. In such cases, the provider should write to the student explaining why it is doing this. The
    
    student should be provided with details of how to appeal the decision and any associated timescale.
    
    At the end of any appeal process, the provider should issue a Completion of Procedures Letter.
    

# **Supporting the student**

1. It is good practice to make sure that procedures are available to all students in accessible formats.Providers should consider on a case-by-case basis whether to make reasonable adjustments toprocedures to take account of the individual needs of students. It is good practice to keep a recordof any adjustments that have been made.
2. Students should be directed towards support services, for example a student representative body,
    
    which can provide helpful independent support and advice to those who wish to pursue a complaint
    
    or academic appeal. It is good practice to provide students with access to support and advice and,
    
    where it is not practical to do so internally, providers should consider making arrangements for
    
    students to access support services at neighbouring institutions, partner providers or other local
    
    community services.
    
3. Providers should have in place well-signposted specific support services such as counselling
    
    services for students with mental health issues. Where appropriate, providers should also direct
    
    students to external services. If a student appears unable to engage effectively with the complaints
    
    or academic appeals procedures, the provider may wish to suggest that the student appoints a
    
    representative. It may be appropriate to suspend the consideration of a complaint or academic
    
    appeal until the student has accessed appropriate support.
    

# **Straightforward language**

1. Providers should make their regulations and procedures accessible and write them clearly and in
    
    straightforward language. Footnotes should be kept to a minimum and acronyms should be defined.
    
2. Procedures and guidance should be written in English and/or Welsh, as appropriate, and comply
    
    with the Welsh Language Standards where they apply. It is reasonable to expect students whose
    
    first language is not English (or Welsh) to be able to follow the complaints or academic appeals
    
    processes, as these are the languages used for tuition, but providers may need to be sympathetic to
    
    individuals who need a degree of language support.
    
3. To avoid possible confusion, providers should not use job titles such as “ombudsman”,
    
    “ombwdsmon”, “ombuds office” or “adjudicator” to describe the roles of those handling complaints
    
    and academic appeals.
    

# **Capturing and sharing learning from complaints and academic appeals**

1. Complaints and academic appeals are a valuable source of feedback and learning. They can help
    
    providers to find ways to improve their services and academic decision making. It is good practice
    
    for providers to record all complaints and academic appeals at the formal and review stages as a
    
    minimum so that the information can be used for analysis and for management and governance
    
    reporting. It’s also important to capture learning from complaints and appeals, including from
    
    concerns that are resolved at the early resolution stage.
    
2. A low volume of student complaints is not of itself an indicator of success. Providers that have been
    
    successful in establishing an open culture of feedback and partnership with students should expect
    
    to receive complaints and appeals. Providers may wish to develop analysis that takes into account
    
    other factors including:
    

```
♦ Whether students understand which process to use and use the right one at the right time;
♦ Whether there are persistent complaints about certain things or common themes in different
complaints;
♦ Whether students’ complaints and appeals are handled in a timely way;
♦ Whether students and their representatives understand the reasons for the provider’s decision
even if they disagree with it.

```

# **Recording concerns, complaints and academic appeals**

1. Providers should have their own records management policies which set out how long information
    
    about student complaints and appeals should be kept. Providers should usually keep full, detailed
    
    records while the issue is being considered and for the time that a student might bring a complaint to
    
    the OIA. Providers may decide to record more limited information in other formats for the purpose of
    
    sharing learning from complaints and appeals.
    
2. The information and level of detail that providers record for sharing learning will vary depending
    
    on the nature and seriousness of the complaint or the complexity of the appeal. As a minimum,
    
    providers should record a summary of the issue or issues raised, relevant dates, and the outcome
    
    including a summary of the reasons for any decisions made.
    
3. Personal information about individual students will need to be removed and care taken to make sure
    
    that students are not identifiable in the summary. Where it is not possible to record information about
    
    a complaint or academic appeal without identifying the student (for example because the cohort is
    
    very small) care should be taken to make sure that only the bare minimum of information is recorded.
    
4. When information is recorded and used in this way, it helps providers to identify and address the
    
    causes of complaints and academic appeals. Providers may identify training opportunities and,
    
    where appropriate, improvements can be introduced.
    

# **Learning from concerns, complaints and academic appeals**

1. Those handling concerns, complaints and academic appeals should always try to make sure that
    
    everyone involved understands the conclusions of the investigation and any decisions made.
    
2. The analysis of management reports on concerns, complaints and academic appeals will help to
    
    make sure that any trends or wider issues are quickly identified and addressed. Good analysis will
    
    consider not only the complaints and appeals that have been received, but where they have not
    
    been received, and any groups of students who are not using the processes. Senior management
    
    should make sure that the provider has procedures in place to act on such reports.
    
3. The reports should be shared with the appropriate committee and officers and the student
    
    representative body where relevant. This may be at school or faculty level, or at provider level,
    
    and may be through quality assurance or resource groups or committees. The level of information
    
    provided in the reports should be proportional to the role of the committee.
    
4. Appropriate summary information should be given to staff and students, including student
    
    representative bodies, on what the provider has done in response to concerns, complaints and
    
    academic appeals. This helps to raise awareness of the procedures and build the confidence of
    
    students and staff in their transparency and effectiveness.
    

# **Accountability for concerns, complaints and academic appeals**

1. Senior management should make sure that:

```
♦ the provider’s final position on a complaint or academic appeal is signed off by someone with
appropriate training and suitable authority to provide assurance that this is the provider’s definitive
response and that the student’s concerns have been taken seriously;
♦ named individuals from senior management maintain overall responsibility and accountability for
the management of handling concerns, complaints and academic appeals within the provider;
♦ senior management has a clear understanding of, and a role in, the complaints and academic
appeals procedures (this will include an oversight role and will not necessarily mean being
involved in the decision-making process);
♦ mechanisms are in place to ensure a consistent approach to the way information about handling
concerns, complaints and academic appeals is managed, monitored, reviewed and reported at all
levels in the provider;
♦ concerns and complaints information is shared within the provider and used to improve services
to students and the student experience;
♦ there is appropriate oversight of complaints and appeals at governance level;
♦ complaints and academic appeals procedures meet the requirements of relevant regulatory
bodies, including the Office for Students (in England), Higher Education Funding Council for
Wales, Commission for Tertiary Education (in Wales), and other PSRBs that regulate specific course
provision.

# **Annex 2: Glossary**

**Academic appeal** - For the purpose of this Framework an academic appeal is a challenge to or request

for reconsideration of a decision by an academic body that makes decisions on student progress,

assessment and awards. This may include a request to change marks or progress decisions, or final

award classifications.

**Complaint** - For the purpose of this Framework a complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction by

one or more students about something a provider has done or not done, or about the standard of

service provided by or on behalf of the provider. A complaint can be about any aspect of student life,

for example about teaching and learning opportunities, assessments, the behaviour of other students

or staff members, facilities, equipment, and support, advice and accommodation services, whether

delivered directly by the provider or by another person or organisation on behalf of the provider. Where

a student wishes to challenge an academic decision this is not normally handled as a complaint.

In line with the language of the Higher Education Act 2004, all submissions to the OIA are called

“complaints” whether they relate to a complaint or an academic appeal.

**Completion of Procedures Letter (often referred to as a COP Letter)** - A Completion of Procedures

Letter is a letter which a provider sends to a student when they have reached the end of the provider’s

internal processes, whenever there is no further avenue for the student internally. Normally a student

can’t complain to us without a COP Letter. We must receive a student’s Complaint Form within 12 months

of the date of the Completion of Procedures Letter. For example, if the Completion of Procedures Letter

is dated 1 January 2022, we must receive the Complaint Form by 1 January 2023.

**Concerns** - In this Framework “concern” means an issue, query or request for clarification that is raised

locally by a student or students.

**Conciliation** - In conciliation, as in mediation, an independent person (the conciliator) tries to help the

people in dispute to resolve their problem. The process is voluntary and confidential. The conciliator

should be impartial and should not take sides. The people in dispute are responsible for deciding how

to resolve the dispute, not the conciliator. In some conciliation, the conciliator gives an opinion about

what is a reasonable resolution.

**Exceptional circumstances** - This Framework describes the processes that should usually apply in

higher education providers. In exceptional circumstances it may be appropriate to follow different

procedures, for example, where it would be very unfair to the student, or the student’s safety might be at

risk, if the procedure is applied strictly. Providers should look at cases individually to see whether there

might be exceptional circumstances.

**Former student** - Students should have access to their provider’s procedures for a reasonable period

after their studies have concluded or been terminated. Providers’ regulations should set out how

long a student has after leaving the provider to bring a complaint or academic appeal, and in what

circumstances other procedures, such as disciplinary or fitness to practise processes, might apply to

them after they have left the provider.

**Governing body (or equivalent)** - The governing body of a provider is sometimes known as either the

board of governors or council. The governing body or its equivalent, is responsible for overseeing the

provider’s activities, deciding its future direction, and fostering an environment in which the provider’s

mission is achieved.

**Learning opportunities** - Learning opportunities refers to how a provider makes its programmes of study

available to learners including all modes, levels and places of study.

**Mediation** - Mediation is a process that is voluntary and confidential. An impartial third party (the

mediator) helps people with a dispute to try and reach an agreement. The people with the dispute, not

the mediator, decide whether they can resolve their issues, and what the outcome should be. Mediation

follows a series of rules or steps that are agreed in advance.

**Requests for additional consideration** – Students are sometimes taken ill before or during an exam or

assessment deadline, or their performance is affected by other unexpected events that are beyond their

control. Students are generally able to ask their higher education provider to take these circumstances

into account. Most providers in England and Wales have a formal process for this, often called the

“mitigating”, “extenuating” or “special circumstances” procedures, or “factors affecting performance”.

**Ombudsman** – An ombudsman is an independent service that investigates and resolves complaints.

Ombudsman schemes are free to use and impartial in their investigations – so they don’t take

sides. They make decisions based on what is fair. As well as providing redress for an individual, an

ombudsman also identifies any systemic issues and provides feedback to help improve services and

complaint handling.

Companies House criteria to register a company name or use a business name with the title

“ombudsman” (from 7 April 2015, if not a statutory body) are that it should:

```
♦ be certified as a provider of Alternative Dispute Resolution by a competent authority;
♦ be an Ombudsman Member of the Ombudsman Association;
♦ have a proven track record in dispute resolution in the relevant sector (normally at least 12
months).

```

**Procedural irregularity** - A procedural irregularity is where the procedures and regulations of a provider

have not been complied with, giving rise to a complaint or appeal.

**Professional, statutory and regulatory body (PSRB)** - Professional, statutory and regulatory bodies

(PSRBs) are authorised to accredit, approve or recognise specific programmes and courses of study

leading to the qualifications of various industries and professions.

**Provider** – The Framework uses the term “provider” to refer to any higher education provider in England

or Wales that is a member of the OIA.

**Reasonable adjustments** - Under the Equality Act 2010, where a disabled person is at a substantial

disadvantage in comparison with people who are not disabled, there is a duty to take reasonable steps

to remove that disadvantage by

(i) changing provisions, criteria or practices;

(ii) altering, removing or providing a reasonable alternative means of avoiding physical features; and

(iii) providing auxiliary aids.

**SCITT** – Provider of School-Centred Initial Teacher Training.

**Student** - The term student includes those taking a course of study, including initial teacher training

trainees studying at a SCITT and higher education apprentices. It includes those on an interruption of

study, temporary withdrawal or temporary exclusion or suspension and those who have recently left a

provider.

**Student experience** - The student experience refers to all the ways a student interacts with the provider

during their course of study. It includes but is broader than the student’s learning opportunities.

**Student representative body** - Student representative bodies, including students’ unions, come in all

shapes and sizes. They play an important role in supporting students who are unhappy with something

they have experienced. Sometimes they can help students and providers to resolve an issue without

formal complaints being made. Or they may provide advice or support to a student going through

a formal process, sometimes acting as an adviser or representative. Most work with providers to

develop and improve regulations and procedures using learning and insights gained from advising and

representing students in complaints and appeals. Providers should support and where possible fund

student representative bodies so that they can provide this service.

Providers have specific responsibilities for students’ unions which are set out in section 22 of the

Education Act 1994.

**Student’s representative** - An individual who is authorised by a student to act on the student’s behalf

through the provider’s processes.
