# **1. Purpose**

**1 Information for students**

```
1.1. The University’s assessment process is subject to quality assurance procedures which are
approved by the Academic Board and which conform to the guidance issued by the Quality
Assurance Agency in its Quality Code. In certain circumstances, all students of the
University, including those who are registered on a course leading to an award of the
University that is delivered through a collaborative partner (for taught students see 3.24-
3.26), have the right of appeal against the decision of an Examination Board.

```

```
1.2. In consideration of Academic Appeals no mark or grade will be awarded without evidence
that a student has met the associated learning outcomes. It is therefore likely that any
successful appeal will result in your having another opportunity. It will not lead to changes of
grade or award. All Appeal outcomes must be within the University Regulations and Policy.

```

```
1.3. If you think you have grounds that entitle you to exercise this right, you are required to inform
the University’s Student Adjudication Team in writing using the Academic Appeal Form
(Stage 1). You cannot instruct a solicitor or other law professional or other third party
representative to write or submit the form for you. The form must be written and submitted by
you. For your information and guidance, the University policy regarding academic appeals
and the procedures to be followed when submitting an appeal is set out in section 3 of this
document for students on taught degrees and in section 4 for Post Graduate Research
(PGR) students.

```

```
1.4. The University of Bedfordshire Students’ Union (Beds SU) and the University's Student
Support Services are able to provide impartial guidance and advice to students who wish to
submit an appeal, including advice on whether their submission constitutes a valid appeal.

```

```
1.5. The University endeavours to resolve all appeals as early as possible and is committed to
dealing openly and fairly with you, if you decide to make an appeal. The University will not
penalise you for appealing.

```

```
1.6. All appeals are considered impartially by someone who is not directly involved in the matter
upon which the appeal is based. This impartiality is protected throughout the process. At
each stage of an appeal a new member of staff is appointed. No member of staff is permitted
to be part of the process at more than one stage.

```

```
1.7. The outcome of a successful academic appeal may provide you with a further opportunity to
demonstrate your knowledge and skills. Further opportunities will normally be offered at the
next formally scheduled offering of a particular unit or assessment. A successful appeal on
its own will not improve the grade or an outcome you have already been awarded.

```

```
1.8. The outcome of an appeal cannot constitute a disadvantage. For students on a taught
course, there will be no reduction in your grade or classification of award as a result of
appeal, including the outcome of any resubmission or additional opportunity of assessment.
For PGR students, there cannot be a disadvantage with regard to academic progression or
any previous recommendation of an Examination Board, including the outcome of any
resubmission or additional opportunity of assessment.

```

1.9. It is important that you understand how an appeal differs from a complaint or a request for

the recognition of mitigating circumstances.

```
a) The University operates a complaints policy and a system for considering mitigating
circumstances. If you wish to raise a complaint or if you request the consideration of
mitigating circumstances, be aware that these need to be made prior to a decision at an
Examination Board. Matters must be brought to the University’s attention before a
specified deadline immediately preceding the relevant Examination Board.

```

```
b) Academic appeals are only valid in respect of Examination Board decisions already
made. Therefore the appeals procedure must be followed after an Examination Board
has taken a decision and students have received their confirmed results. Note that it is
only through the appeals process that issues relating to an Examination Board decision
can be resolved.

```

1.10. Your attention is drawn especially to the sections in section 3 for taught students, and

section 4 for PGR students of this policy entitled: Circumstances in which academic appeals

can be made, that set out the grounds of an appeal and the timescale which should be

adhered to in connection with the submission of an appeal.

1.11. You may only appeal if you are a registered student. Your acceptance of an award certificate

at graduation implies acceptance of the award and the closure of any action/appeal within

the University's procedure. This equally applies if you do not return a certificate or an award

letter that has been sent to you in the post within 10 working days.

1.12. The University will only consider an appeal from you if you are directly affected by the

Examination Board’s decision or, in addition if you are a PGR student, the decision of the

Academic Progress Panel (APP). Appeals by third parties, or appeals which are made

anonymously, will not be considered. An appeal may not be submitted by a solicitor or other

legal professional and a legal letter may not be appended to the form, The Academic Appeal

Form (Stage1) must be fully completed by the student and cannot be used as a coversheet

for appended information. If you are one of a group of students on a taught course affected

by the same set of circumstances, you may wish to make a collective appeal through a

single spokesperson with the agreement of all members of the group.

1.13. You may only appeal if you are a registered student and in good financial and academic

standing, or (if an appeal is lodged after a final award/withdrawal decision) in relation to a

period in which you were in good financial and academic standing. Although you may

appeal while sanctioned for financial or academic reasons, no appeal outcome will be

implemented until your position in the University has been recovered.

1.14. You will not normally be permitted to appeal on the basis of bereavement or for a suspension

of studies. In neither of these cases is an appeal appropriate, because appeals are

retrospective and these matters are difficult to resolve fairly in retrospect. You are advised to

use the University’s support services in these cases.

1.15. If your appeal is not based on the grounds specified in this Policy or accompanied by

appropriate supporting evidence, or is submitted out of time, the University will inform you

that no action will be taken. You will be informed of your right to request a Completion of

Procedures Letter (http://oiahe.org.uk) if you wish to pursue the matter further with the Office

of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education.

```
1.16. If you submit information that is false, as part of your appeal, the University will refer the
matter for consideration as a disciplinary offence under the Student Code of Conduct and
Disciplinary Policy.

```

```
1.17. As a taught student you will not normally be permitted to attend classes where you have not
yet successfully appealed against a decision that may have prevented your attendance.
However, Faculty Managers may exceptionally permit attendance, where non-attendance
would have a detrimental impact on your academic progress should your appeal be upheld.
Please note that this will not constitute formal progress until such a time that a successful
outcome of the appeal has been achieved.

```

```
1.18. It is your responsibility, when submitting an appeal, to state clearly which one or more of the
bases for appeal specified in the academic appeals policy you are giving as the basis of your
appeal, and to explain why you are raising any matters of personal circumstance after the
Examination Board decision and not within the University’s mitigating circumstances
process. You must also provide evidence of any claims you make, and specify clearly the
units and assessments to which your appeal refers.

```

```
1.19. If you submit a complaint, within the University’s Student Complaints Policy, and there is
clear potential for a positive academic outcome to that complaint to require reconsideration
of an examination board decision, the University will identify your complaint as an academic
appeal and deal with it according to its Academic Appeals Policy.

```

```
1.20. Members of University staff, parents or lawyers/solicitors may not submit an academic
appeal on your behalf. Any legal letter submitted by you or on your behalf will not be
accepted as part of a Stage One Appeal.

# **2. Scope**

**2. Introduction to the Academic Appeal Policy and Process**

```
2.1. An academic appeal is a request for review of an Examination Board decision or an
Academic Progress Panel (APP) related to assessment results, academic progression
and/or award. Where a complaint is specified as having an impact on assessment results,
academic progression and/or award, it must be treated as an academic appeal. No mark or
grade will be awarded without evidence that a student has met the associated learning
outcomes. Academic appeals may not, therefore, result in changes of grade (other than as
required to permit a further opportunity) or breaches of University academic regulations. Any
appeal outcome that a Faculty deems to require action outside policy must be presented to
the TQSC Exceptions Panel.

```

```
2.2. Academic appeals are only valid in respect of Examination Board decisions. Therefore the
appeals procedure must be followed after an Examination Board has taken a decision and a
student has received their confirmed results. It is only through the appeals process that
issues relating to an Examination Board decision can be resolved. The Student Complaints
Procedure is to be used prior to a decision at an Examination Board, ensuring that matters
that have potentially impacted on student performance are brought to the attention of the
relevant Examination Board or APP. Matters that are considered as academic appeals may
not subsequently be considered as complaints.

```

```
2.3. The University operates a process by which Faculties are able to raise issues that impact on
standards or quality in respect of individual students or particular groups. This is separate
from the process for individual student appeals (see Appendix 5).

```

```
2.4. As far as possible, within the effective operation of this process, impartiality and
confidentiality of both individuals and proceedings will be maintained.

```

```
2.5. Academic appeals are not valid where they relate to academic judgement (including
Academic Concerns and decisions of the Academic Conduct Panel (ACP)). Academic
judgment is about the quality of academic performance or content.

```

```
2.6. For Academic appeal information for students on taught courses please see section 3 and
for postgraduate research students please see section 4. Appeals in relation to the taught
component of postgraduate research programmes should be considered within section 3.

```

```
2.7. The Academic Board will annually review the operation of the appeals procedure in order to
evaluate its effectiveness. Exceptions granted under the Academic Appeals Policy are
recorded by the Academic Registrar within the TQSC standing panel to ensure consistency
of decision-making across processes. The Adjudication Team will formally highlight to the
Chair of TQSC where there are a number of cases emerging with the same operational

```

```
problem, so that the matter can be reviewed as such rather than as a series of individual
appeals. This will be measured over a period of 3 months to ascertain whether cases of a
similar nature are reoccurring. The Chair of TQSC’s investigation is to be reported back to
Adjudication with any action required notified to TQSC.

```

```
2.8. Complaints about the procedural operation of this process must be raised through the
Student Complaints Process. Such complaints may not request further review of the
academic decision previously appealed, but must be confined to the expression of a specific
concern related to the operation of the appeal process.

```

**3. Policy** (^)

**3. For students on a taught course (including any taught component of research**

**programmes)**

**Circumstances in which academic appeals may be made**

```
3.1. Full-time and part-time students of the University who are registered or whose period of
registration has ended following an Examination Board decision may submit appeals to the
University against decisions of Examination Boards. Appeals may relate either to (a) an
award made at the end of the final stage of a course or (b) a decision that would result in an
interruption of studies or disadvantage at an intermediate stage of a course. The latter may
include an interruption of the normal progress of a student, a requirement either to
withdraw from a course, to undertake resits, to retake an element of a course, or to register
for/receive an award other than the target award at the point of appeal, and the award of a
grade that can be demonstrated not to reflect a student’s performance in circumstances of
full opportunity.

```

```
3.2. Valid bases for appeal in respect of an academic outcome are:

```

```
Exceptional mitigating circumstances

```

```
a) These arise where a student establishes to the satisfaction of the University (by submitting
medical certificates or other documentary evidence acceptable to the University) that his/her
assessment performance was adversely affected by illness or some other reason which
he/she was unable, or for valid reasons unwilling, to divulge before the Examination Board
reached its decision

```

Note: Academic Appeals may not normally be submitted on the basis of bereavement. The

University’s Mitigating Circumstances process must be used in such cases.

```
Medical and other circumstances that should have been reported to the University at the time
of their occurrence will not normally be accepted as grounds for appeal. Students are
expected to contact Student Support at the time of the occurrence and follow the University's
Mitigating Circumstances process where appropriate.

```

```
Where a student has been absent from their studies without the University's knowledge, they
may not normally subsequently appeal in relation to that period.

```

**Operational problems impacting on academic outcome**

```
b) This arises where the University is satisfied on the basis of evidence produced by the student
or derived from any other source that the assessments were not conducted in accordance
with the relevant Regulations, or that a material administrative error or some other material
irregularity occurred in relation to teaching or assessment (including project and placement
units), such that assessment performance was materially and adversely affected.

```

```
3.3. The University only considers appeals that are based within the Regulations. It will not
consider any appeal that is based solely on a request for the student to be given another
opportunity to change a grade, or any attempt to alter the outcomes of academic judgement
reached through due academic process, including decisions of the Academic Conduct Panel.

```

```
3.4. Appeals may not be made in respect of matters relating to academic performance before
Examination Boards have reached their decisions in regard to such matters.

```

```
3.5. Where the claim of operational problems includes allegations of victimisation or unfair
discrimination, the University will, in the first instance, investigate these claims through the
University Student Complaints Procedure, to inform the appeal process.

```

```
3.6. Students who are sanctioned for financial or academic reasons may submit and receive a
response to their appeal, but no outcome will be actioned before their good standing is
recovered.

```

```
3.7. Requests to suspend studies will not normally be granted in retrospect through this appeals
process (i.e. where the request is made after the pre-examination-board deadline set by the
University’s Mitigation Team). Requests relating to multiple assessments over a period of
time will normally be considered as requests for additional opportunity without penalty.

```

```
3.8. The Student Adjudication Team will respond to any issues lodged as academic appeals but
which fall outside the scope of academic appeal, confirming that the appeal is not valid and
indicating alternative approaches where relevant (see also Introduction: Information to
Students).

```

```
3.9. It is expected that the need to appeal will only occur as a last resort; students must ensure
that, as far as possible, the Examination Board is informed prior to its meeting using the
University’s processes (e.g. use of the Mitigation Team) of any circumstances which might
have adversely affected their performance.

```

```
3.10. Acceptance of an award certificate or a failure to respond within 10 working days of receipt
constitutes acceptance of the award and the closure of any appeal within the University's
procedures.

```

```
3.11. The Chair of the Appeal Review Board will nominate a team of senior academic staff,
including at least one member of Academic Board, to review appeals lodged by students on
taught courses, ensuring that all such appeals are considered by an appeal reviewer not
within the Faculty to which an appeal pertains. The Chair of the Appeal Review Board will
brief new Appeal Reviewers on the process and cases. All reviewers are expected to
undertake equality and diversity training before or as soon as possible after appointment.

```

```
3.12. The Student Adjudication Team will report to Academic Board after the end of each
academic year on the activity and outcomes of academic appeals.

```

```
3.13. Where issues of common occurrence and/or impact arise in the course of an academic year,
this will be included in the annual report.

```

```
3.14. The Appeal Reviewer is empowered to take four courses of action following its consideration
of an appeal by a student on a taught course:

```

```
i. to reject an appeal, in which case the decision is final;

```

```
ii. to uphold the appeal, and require an Examination Board to review or revise its
decision or process where one or both of the two possible grounds for appeal is
found to have had material impact on the performance or progression of a student;

```

```
iii. to require an Examination Board to reconsider or revise its decision where an
appeal, as presented, is not upheld, but other material factors emerge in the course
of investigation or appeal;

```

```
iv. to determine that for reasons other than the non-provision of information and
evidence by the appellant, an appeal cannot be resolved at stage one and should
proceed to stage two.

```

```
3.15. Neither a Reviewer nor an Academic Appeal Panel has authority to set aside the decision of
the Examination Board or recommend award.

```

```
3.16. No decision will be revised within this Academic Appeals Policy to the detriment of a student.

```

```
3.17. A revised decision of an Examination Board resulting from this process shall be final and
may not be the subject of further appeal unless it can be evidenced that:

```

- the basis of any further appeal is new information that was not available at the timeof the earlier appeal;
- the new appeal arises from circumstances obtaining only as a consequence of theearlier appeal
- the appeal relates to the implementation of the earlier appeal outcome.

```
3.18. Where there is evidence that an appellant or their representative may have provided
misinformation to influence the outcome of an academic appeal, disciplinary action may be
taken after the conclusion of the appeal process.

```

**Procedure**

**Submitting an appeal**

```
3.19. A student who wishes to exercise their right to appeal against a decision of an Examination
Board must do so by completing the Academic Appeal Form (Stage1) and sending it to the
Student Adjudication Team (adjudication@beds.ac.uk). The student must write and submit
the form as submission from University staff, parents/guardians or legal professionals is not
permitted.

```

```
3.20. The student must specify precisely the grounds on which the appeal is based (see section
3.2 above) and provide all supporting documentary evidence that they wish to be considered.
The Stage 1 appeal reviewer or Stage 2 appeal review panel will normally receive and
consider the following in support of an appeal:

```

- A completed academic appeal form
- Supporting evidence referenced in the appeal form
- Material provided by those directly involved in the stage two panel meeting (at stagetwo of the process)

```
3.21. Appeals must be received by the University at adjudication@beds.ac.uk within 15 working
days from the date on which the student received formal notification of a decision of an
Examination Board online via the student results portal on SITS Evision.

```

```
3.22. Students will normally be deemed to have received such formal notification of their
assessments, or academic progression decision 48 hours after confirmation by the
Examination Board.

```

```
3.23. The University has the right, under exceptional circumstances, to waive these time- scales,
where there is clear evidence provided by an appellant of circumstances that might
reasonably hinder an on-time submission. These include the consideration of matters of
health and disability where these can be reasonably concluded to have impeded on-time
submission within the standard 15 working day timeframe for appeal submissions.

```

```
3.24. Academic appeals submitted by students at associate collaborative partner institutions will
be processed according to this policy, unless a variation, limited to stage one consideration,
is exceptionally agreed by the University through its standard approval processes for
collaborative provision.

```

```
3.25. Students studying at the University's accredited collaborative partner institutions should
follow the academic appeals policy of their home institution, which the University will have
approved as being consonant with its procedures. Applications by students to review these
decisions may be considered by the University under the appeals review procedures.

```

```
3.26. Appeal outcomes relating to students other than those considered at an accredited
collaborative partner will be lodged on SITS by Faculty Office staff. Reporting on appeal
outcomes will form part of accredited partner annual reporting.

```

**Stage One**

```
3.27. The Student Adjudication Team will receive an academic appeal in writing that specifies the
basis of the appeal and provides relevant supplementary evidence, and will confirm receipt
to the appellant. If the appeal is submitted out of time or does not meet the criteria for appeal
specified in paragraph 3.2 above, the Student Adjudication Team will inform the student that
no action will be taken. The student will be informed of their right to request a Completion of
Procedures Letter (http://oiahe.org.uk) if they wish to pursue the matter further with the Office
of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education. If the appeal is submitted within time
and meets the criteria for appeal specified in paragraph 3.2, the Student Adjudication Team
will forward the appeal documentation to the nominated appeal reviewer.

```

```
3.28. The role of the Reviewer and, on their behalf where necessary a departmental administrator
as investigator, will be to identify and examine all evidence that may support the appeal, and
to answer questions raised by the reviewer. This should include relevant evidence gathered
internally from within the University, but will not include testimonials from students or staff
unless explicitly requested by the reviewer

```

```
3.29. The Reviewer will aim to respond, through Adjudication and then the Head of Academic
Services via appeals@beds.ac.uk to the student submitting the appeal, within 10 working
days of receipt of the appeal and supplementary evidence (in full), in order to do one of the
following:

```

```
a) to uphold the appeal, and to inform the student of the findings of the investigation and confirm
that the relevant Examination Board will be required to review or revise its decision (through
Chair’s action) in respect of the student.

```

```
b) to not uphold the appeal, and to provide the student with a clear and complete reason for not
doing so.

```

```
c) to confirm to the student a deadline for response (where the appeal circumstances require a
protracted investigation) in respect of a) or b) above.

```

```
d) in exceptional circumstances to confirm that a case cannot be addressed adequately at stage
one and will therefore proceed to stage two.

```

```
3.30. Once an appeal has been upheld, no further appeal on the same matter will be permitted,
subject to the exceptions detailed in 3.17 above.

```

```
3.31. Academic appeal decisions relate only to academic credit and will not override Professional,
Statutory or Regulatory Body (PSRB) regulations and requirements. Appeal outcome letters
will state this proviso in relation to any decision to uphold. Where such regulations and
requirements prevent the implementation of an academic appeal outcome, the Faculty
Manager must a) obtain external examiner confirmation of this constraint, b) record this
formally in the record for the next relevant Examination Board and c) inform the Student
Adjudication Team, so that the revised outcome can be filed along with the initial decision.

```

```
3.32. Where it is confirmed that the University does not find the appeal to be substantiated and the
stage one appeal is not upheld, a student will, on the proviso that he/she can supply
additional and significant evidence or information directly related to the initial appeal, have
the right to proceed to stage two of the appeals procedure.

```

**Stage Two**

```
3.33. Where a student is not satisfied that the outcome of the investigation of stage one of the
Academic Appeals Procedure is founded on full or accurate consideration of the
circumstances of appeal, he/she may request that an Appeal Review Panel reviews the
case, through the stage two procedure, only on the basis of new and significant information
or evidence.

```

```
3.34. A student who wishes an Appeal Review Panel to review his/her appeal, must inform the
Student Adjudication Team within ten working days of receipt of the outcome (students will
be deemed to have received notification on the date the outcome is communicated to them

```

```
by email to a known email address declared on the student record or the email address from
which they submitted the appeal). Requests for a stage two review must be made using the
Appeal Review Form (Stage 2).

```

3.35. In requesting a review of an appeal decision, a student may not introduce new grounds for

appeal or any supplementary evidence beyond that directly related to the initial basis of

appeal.

3.36. Where the basis of appeal remains the same, but additional new, directly relevant evidence

or information is presented, the Student Adjudication Team will confirm receipt and will

establish an Academic Review Panel. The Chair of the Stage 2 review is responsible for

investigating the background to any new information provided within stage two, prior to the

review panel meeting. They may request additional evidence prior to the panel meeting, but

not afterwards. Where individuals from the department are identified in relation to the

appeal, they are invited to be part of the process. The Student Adjudication Team will inform

the appellant of the date, time and location of the Appeal Review Panel meeting at which

their case will be heard, giving the student five working days’ notice where possible, or where

the student accepts a lesser period.

3.37. Where there is a substantive alteration or addition to the initial basis of appeal, or where the

original appeal is restated without new evidence or information directly related to that initial

appeal, the Student Adjudication Team will respond, within ten working days of receipt of the

renewed appeal, to confirm the outcome of the previous investigation and a Completion of

Procedures letter will be issued within 28 days.

3.38. Students have the right to appear in person at the meeting of the Appeal Review Panel held

on one of the University's campuses at which their appeal is considered, and to be

accompanied at such meetings by a Beds SU representative or another currently registered

student if they so wish. Students who decide to avail themselves of either one of these

opportunities are required to notify the University of the name and affiliation of the person

who will accompany them in advance of the meeting.

3.39. The role of any accompanying individual will be to assist in the clarification of any matters

raised by the Panel. They may not otherwise represent the appellant throughout the

proceedings.

3.40. The Appeal Review Panel may request a student to attend the meeting at which his or her

appeal is heard and in the event he/she will be notified by the Student Adjudication Team of

the time and place of the meeting.

3.41. Where a student is unable to attend the meeting of the Appeal Review Panel, but wishes to

participate, he or she may do so through videoconferencing facilities where these are

available or by representation by another individual (for example, a Beds SU representative),

subject to the approval of the panel Chair.

3.42. The Appeal Review Panel may require appropriately qualified, senior academic

representation from the Department or Faculty associated with the Examination Board

decision that is appealed. This will include a staff member who is qualified to represent the

position of any PSRB involved in the provision to which the appeal relates.

3.43. Where student and Faculty/Department representation is required, the Appeal Review Panel

will meet the representatives together.

```
3.44. The Appeal Review Panel will be chaired by a member of Academic Board nominated by the
University Secretary and other than the Reviewer of any stage one appeal relating to the
same matter. The Chair will be joined by two additional senior members of staff, of which at
least one should be a senior member of staff (grade 9 or above).

```

```
3.45. No member of the Faculty responsible for the decision against which an appeal is being
made shall be a member of the Appeal Review Panel.

```

```
Outcomes

```

```
3.46. A review conducted by the Appeal Review Panel at stage two will lead to one of the following
outcomes:

```

```
a) to uphold the stage two appeal, and inform the student of the conclusion of the review and
confirm that the relevant Examination Board will be required to review or revise its decision or
process in respect of the student;

```

```
b) to not uphold the stage two appeal, and inform the student that the review has upheld the
previous appeal outcome and that no revision of Examination Board decision will be initiated,
and a Completion of Procedures letter will be provided within 28 days;

```

```
c) to inform the student that the review upheld the procedure and outcome of the previous
investigation (stage one) but other factors have since been identified as leading to a
requirement for revision of the Examination Board.

```

```
No revision will be undertaken within this process to the detriment of the appellant.

```

```
3.47. The Student Adjudication Team will inform the student of the outcome within 15 working
days of the Appeal Review Panel, and a Completion of Procedures letter will be issued
where required within 28 days.

```

```
3.48. The outcome of the review will be final within the University’s processes (subject to the terms
of 3.17 above), and will include confirmation of any related PSRB restriction considered by
the Appeal Review Panel.

```

```
3.49. Where there is evidence that an appellant or their representative may have provided
misinformation to influence the outcome of an academic appeal, disciplinary action may be
taken after the conclusion of the appeal process.

```

**4. For postgraduate research students**

```
Circumstances in which academic appeals may be made

```

```
4.1. Full-time and part-time PGR students of the University who are registered or whose period of
registration has ended following a Research Degree Committee decision may submit
appeals to the University. Appeals may relate to a decision that would result in an

```

```
interruption of academic progress arising from a requirement to withdraw, to resubmit a
programme approval or transfer report, or to register for/receive an award other than the
target award at the point of appeal.

```

4.2. Submission of a thesis/dissertation in partial completion of the requirements for a research

degree award constitutes confirmation that a candidate is satisfied that the supervisory and

other processes underpinning that submission have been appropriate and complete.

Therefore no academic appeal may be lodged in respect of these matters after submission.

The University has processes for complaint and grievance arising during the study period,

and students are expected to use these if issues arise in the operation of supervision. In the

case that an appeal relies substantively on such issues, the University will take into

consideration the availability of processes that would have addressed matters earlier.

4.3. Valid bases for appeal in respect of an academic outcome as defined in 4.1 above are:

```
Exceptional mitigating circumstances

```

```
a) These arise where a student establishes to the satisfaction of the University (by
submitting medical certificates or other documentary evidence acceptable to the
University) that his/her assessment performance was adversely affected by illness or
some other reason which he/she was unable, or for valid reasons unwilling, to divulge
before completion of the RS1 Programme Approval or RS4 Transfer stages or a viva
event.

```

```
Note: Academic appeals may not normally be submitted on the basis of bereavement. The
University's Mitigating Circumstances process must be used in such cases.

```

```
Medical and other circumstances that should have been reported to the University at
the time of their occurrence will not normally be considered. Students are expected
to contact Student Support at the time of the occurrence and follow the University's
Mitigating Circumstances process where appropriate.

```

```
Where a student has been absent from their studies without the University's
knowledge, they may not normally subsequently appeal in relation to that period.

```

```
Appeals relating to circumstances obtaining prior to the submission of a dissertation
of thesis in partial completion of the requirements for postgraduate degree award
may not be lodged after submission of the dissertation or thesis, since submission is
ta ken to constitute confirmation of satisfactory completion by a candidate.

```

```
Operational problems impacting on academic outcome

```

```
b) This arises where the University is satisfied on the basis of evidence produced by the
student or derived from any other source that supervision or assessment were not
conducted in accordance with the relevant regulations or that a material
administrative error or some other material irregularity occurred in relation to teaching
or assessment, such that assessment performance was materially and adversely
affected.

```

```
Note: Academic appeals may not be submitted in relation to the operation of supervisory or
other processes after submission of a dissertation/thesis, since submission of these items
constitutes confirmation of satisfactory completion by the candidate. Academic appeals are
permitted on the basis of events or processes occurring after the submission of a thesis or
dissertation

```

4.4. Where the claim of operational problems includes allegations of victimisation or unfair

discrimination, the University will, in the first instance, investigate these claims through the

University Student Complaints Procedure, to inform the appeal process.

4.5. Students who are sanctioned for financial or academic reasons may submit and receive a

response to their appeal, but no outcome will be actioned before their good standing is

recovered.

4.6. The University only considers appeals that are based within the Regulations. It will not

consider any appeal on the grounds of a disagreement with academic judgement, including

requirements for resubmission of a thesis. An appeal can therefore not be based solely on a

request for the student to be given another opportunity to change an outcome, or any

attempt to alter the outcomes of academic judgement reached through due academic

process, including decisions made in respect of academic practice or research misconduct.

4.7. The Student Adjudication Team will respond to any issues lodged as academic appeals but

which fall outside the scope of academic appeal, confirming that the appeal is not valid and

indicating alternative approaches where relevant (see also Introduction: Information to

Students).

4.8. It is expected that the need to appeal will only occur as a last resort; students must ensure

that, as far as possible, the Research Degrees Committee is informed, through the Research

Graduate School, prior to its meeting using the University’s processes (e.g. use of the

mitigation team) of any circumstances which might have adversely affected their

performance.

4.9. Acceptance of an award letter, or a failure to respond within 10 working days of receipt

constitutes acceptance of the award and the closure of any appeal within the University's

procedures.

4.10. The Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic) will nominate a reviewer to consider appeals in

relation to postgraduate research students (PGR) at stage one.

4.11. The University Secretary will report to Academic Board after the end of each academic year

on the activity and outcomes of PGR academic appeals.

4.12. Where issues of common occurrence and/or impact arise in the course of an academic year,

this will be included in the annual report to Academic Board.

### **4.13. The stage one Reviewer is empowered to take one of the following courses of action**

```
following its consideration of an appeal against an APP decision:

```

```
(i) to reject an appeal;

```

```
(ii) to uphold the appeal, and require the Research Degrees Committee to take action in
line with University regulations, on the basis that the appeal is upheld in principle;

```

```
(iii) to determine that an appeal cannot be resolved at stage one and must progress to
stage two.

```

```
A revised decision of the Research Degrees Committee resulting from this appeal process
shall be final.

```

**Procedure**

**Submitting an appeal**

```
4.14. A student who wishes to exercise their right to appeal to the University, following a confirmed
Research Degrees Committee decision must do so by completing the Academic Appeal
Form (Stage 1) and sending it to the Student Adjudication Team (adjudication@beds.ac.uk).
The student must write and submit the form as submission from University staff,
parents/guardians or legal professionals is not permitted.

```

```
4.15. The student must specify precisely the grounds on which the appeal is based (see section
4.3.) and any supporting documentary evidence that the student wishes to be considered by
the University.

```

```
4.16. Appeals must be received by the Student Adjudication Team within 15 working days from the
date on which the student received formal notification of a decision of an Examination Board
or APP ratified by the Research Degrees Committee.

```

```
4.17. Students will normally be deemed to have received formal notification of their assessments,
or academic progression decision 48 hours after confirmation by the Research Degrees
Committee.

```

```
4.18. The University has the right, under exceptional circumstances, to waive these time-scales.

```

```
4.19. A PGR student studying with collaborative partners will have their appeal considered under
this policy.

```

**Stage One**

```
4.20. The Student Adjudication Team will receive an academic appeal in writing that specifies the
basis of the appeal and provides relevant supplementary evidence, and will confirm receipt
to the appellant. If the appeal is submitted out of time or does not meet the criteria for appeal
specified in paragraph 4.2 above, the Student Adjudication Team will inform the student that
no action will be taken. The student will be informed of their right to request a Completion of
Procedures Letter (http://oiahe.org.uk) if they wish to pursue the matter further with the Office
of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education. If the appeal is submitted within time
and meets the criteria for appeal specified in paragraph 4.3, the Student Adjudication Team
will forward the appeal documentation to the Deputy Vice Chancellor (Academic) who will
nominate a Reviewer in accordance with paragraph 4.10, as a stage one Reviewer.

```

```
4.21. The role of the Reviewer and, on their behalf (if requested) an independent member of the
Academic Services Department as investigator, will be to identify and examine all evidence
that may support the appeal, and to answer questions raised by the reviewer.

```

```
4.22. The Reviewer will aim to respond, through Adjudication and then the Head of Academic
Services via appeals@beds.ac.uk to the student submitting the appeal, within 10 working
days of receipt of the appeal and supplementary evidence (in full), in order to do one of the
following:

```

```
a) to uphold the appeal, and inform the student of the findings of the investigation and
confirm that the Research Degrees Committee will be asked to consider appropriate action;
b) to inform a student that the appeal will be heard as a stage two appeal;
c)to not uphold the appeal, and inform the student of the findings of the investigation and
confirm the basis on which the University does not find the appeal to be substantiated;
d) to confirm to the student a deadline for response (where the appeal circumstances
require a protracted investigation) in respect of a) above.

```

```
4.23. Once an appeal has been successful no further appeal in respect of the same matter(s) will
be permitted.

```

```
4.24. Where it is confirmed that the University does not find the appeal to be substantiated and the
stage one appeal is not upheld, a student will, on the proviso that they can supply additional
significant evidence or information directly related to the initial appeal, have the right to apply
to the University for reconsideration of his/her appeal and proceed to stage two of the
appeals procedure.

```

**Stage Two**

```
4.25. Where a student is not satisfied that the outcome of the investigation of an appeal is founded
on full or accurate consideration of the circumstances of appeal, they may request that an
Appeal Review Panel reviews the case. This will only be permitted on the basis of new and
significant information or evidence.

```

```
4.26. A student who wishes an Appeal Review Panel to review their appeal must inform the
Student Adjudication Team within ten working days of the outcome (students will be deemed
to have received notification on the date the outcome is communicated to them by email to a
known email address declared on the student record or the email address from which they
submitted the appeal). Requests for a stage two review must be made using the Appeal
Review Form (Stage 2).

```

```
4.27. In requesting a review of a stage one decision, a student may not introduce new grounds for
appeal or any supplementary evidence beyond that directly related to the initial basis of
appeal.

```

```
4.28. Where there is a substantive alteration or addition to the initial basis of appeal, or where the
original appeal is restated without new evidence or information directly related to that initial
appeal, the Student Adjudication Team will respond, within ten working days to confirm the
outcome of the previous investigation and a Completion of Procedures letter will be issued
within 28 days.

```

4.29. Where the basis of appeal remains the same, but additional new, directly relevant evidence

or information is presented, the Student Adjudication Team will confirm receipt and will

arrange a meeting of an Appeal Review Panel. The Student Adjudication Team will inform

the appellant of the Appeal Review Panel meeting at which their case will be heard.

4.30. The meeting of the Appeal Review Panel will be chaired by an active researcher, nominated

by the University Secretary. The Chair will be joined by two additional senior members of

staff, of which at least one is a researcher who is an active supervisor.

4.31. No member of Academic Board shall act who is a member of the Faculty or Research

Institute responsible for the decision against which an appeal is being made. The Deputy

Vice Chancellor (Academic) may nominate the panel but not be a member. The Director of

Research Development (including any individuals formally deputizing for them) will not be

permitted as a panel member. The Chair of the Stage 2 review is responsible for

investigating the background to any new information provided within stage two, prior to the

review panel meeting. They may request additional evidence prior to the panel meeting, but

not afterwards. Where individuals from the department are identified in relation to the

appeal, they are invited to be part of the process. The Student Adjudication Team will inform

the appellant of the date, time and location of the Appeal Review Panel meeting at which

their case will be heard, giving the student five working days’ notice where possible, or where

the student accepts a lesser period.

4.32. A student has the right to appear in person at the Appeal Review Panel at which their appeal

is considered, and to be accompanied at such meetings by a Beds SU representative, or

their research supervisor or a currently registered student if they so wish. Students who

decide to avail themselves of one of these opportunities are required to notify the University

of the name and affiliation of the person who will accompany them.

4.33. The role of any accompanying individual will be to assist in the clarification of any matters

raised by the Panel. They may not otherwise represent the appellant throughout the

proceedings.

4.34. The Appeal Review Panel may request a student to attend the meeting at which his or her

appeal is heard and in the event he/she will be notified by the Student Adjudication Team of

the time and place of the meeting.

4.35. Where a student is unable to attend the meeting of the Appeal Review Panel, but wishes to

participate, he or she may do so through videoconferencing facilities where these are

available or by representation by another individual (for example, a representative of Beds

SU), subject to the approval of the Chair.

4.36. Where an external examiner is involved directly in the basis of an appeal, and in all cases

where an appeal relates to the operation of a viva, external examiners will be invited to

attend (or submit written evidence, if they prefer) the meeting of the Appeal Review Panel.

The Chair will provide questions to be answered by the external examiner. Where the

external examiner is not present as a panel member, their confirmation of the outcome will

be required.

4.37. Where student and Faculty/ Research Institute representation is required, the Appeal Review

Panel will meet the representatives together.

**Outcomes**

```
4.38. The review conducted by the Appeal Review Panel will lead to one of the following
outcomes:

```

```
a) to not uphold the stage two appeal, and inform the student that the review has upheld
the previous appeal outcome/decision/examination board outcome and a Completion of
Procedures letter will be provided within 28 days;

```

```
b) to uphold the appeal and inform the student that the Research Degrees Committee will
be requested to consider appropriate action;

```

```
c) to inform the student that the review upheld the procedure and outcome of the previous
appeal outcome/decision/examination board outcome but other factors have since been
identified as leading to a requirement for reconsideration by the Research Degrees
Committee.

```

```
4.39. No revision will be undertaken within this process to the detriment of the appellant.

```

```
4.40. The Student Adjudication Team will inform the student of the outcome within 15 working
days of the Appeal Review Panel, and a Completion of Procedures letter will be issued
where required within 28 days.

```

```
4.41. The outcome of the Appeal Review Panel will be final within the University’s processes.

```

```
4.42. Where there is evidence that an appellant or his/her representative may have provided
misinformation to influence the outcome of an academic appeal, disciplinary action may
be taken after the conclusion of the appeal process.

```

**5. The Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA)**

```
5.1. The decision of an Appeal Review Panel is the final stage within the University’s
procedures for considering academic appeals. When this final stage has been
completed, you will be provided with a Completion of Procedures letter. W here your
appeal is deemed to be out of time or to have no grounds, or is concluded at stage one,
or is upheld at any stage of the process, you will be advised of your right to request a
Completion of Procedures letter. This letter formally acknowledges that the University’s
internal processes have been completed and you will need it if you wish to refer your
complaint to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA).

```

```
5.2. If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of your appeal you may be able to make a
complaint to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education (OIA)
provided that your complaint is eligible under its rules.

```

```
5.3. Should you decide to make a complaint to the OIA, your complaint must be submitted on
an OIA Complaint Form. This can be downloaded from the OIA website here:
http://www.oiahe.org.uk. Alternatively, you can telephone or write to the OIA for a form.

```

```
You should send a copy of your Completion of Procedures letter to the OIA with your
completed Complaint Form.

```

```
5.4. Your completed Complaint Form must be received by the OIA within twelve months of
the date of your Completion of Procedures letter (i.e. if the Completion of Procedures
letter is dated 1 January 2018 then your complaint must be received by the OIA on or
before 1 January 2019).

```

```
5.5. Guidance on submitting a complaint to the OIA can also be found on its website
http://oiahe.org.uk/making-a-complaint-to -the-oia/how-to -make-a-complaint.aspx. You
may also wish to seek advice from the Students’ Union about taking your complaint to
the OIA.

```

```
5.6. Please note that the OIA will normally only review issues that have been dealt with
through the University’s internal procedures.

```

**6. The provision of information to External Examiners**

```
6.1. Where the outcome of an appeal requires the revision and reconsideration of an
Examination Board decision, external examiners responsible and/or involved in that
decision will be informed. In the case of taught provision considered at Examination
Boards this will be through the presentation of a record of Chair’s actions at Portfolio
Boards, and in the case of PGR decisions this will be by correspondence (through the
Research Graduate School).

# **Appendix 5**

### **UNIVERSITY OF BEDFORDSHIRE**

### **Faculty Process for Consideration of Exception by TQSC**

The University operates a process by which Faculties are able to raise issues that impact on standards or quality in

respect of individual students or particular groups. This is separate from the process for individual student appeals. It

permits Faculties to identify matters of which students themselves may not be aware, and to propose solutions to

circumstances that students may not understand to be available. It also ensures that issues and solutions relevant to

particular groups of students are not available inequitably only to those students within a particular group who choose

to lodge an appeal.

All such matters require Faculty TQSC approval prior to submission for TQSC consideration.

A standing panel comprising the TQSC Chair, the Academic Registrar, the Director of Research Development and the

lead academic appeal reviewer (each with a specified alternative in case of any conflict of interest or absence) will

consider issues raised by Faculties. The standing panel will make decisions on exceptions requested. All panel

members (or their alternates) must submit a formal response to each issue raised by the Academic Registrar, and be

in agreement for approval to be final. Decision of the standing panel will be reported to TQSC via records created and

maintained by the Academic Registrar.

Criteria for panel consideration are:

1. There are clearly documented factors other than those that form the basis of academic appeals, i.e. at least one ofthe following:the case relates to a clearly defined group of students to whom the same particular circumstances

```
apply;

```

- the case relates to an individual student and to a specific operational issue for which a University

```
department accepts responsibility

```

- the case relates to circumstances of which a student or defined group of students are unlikely to be

```
aware;

```

- the case is prompted by operational problems for which the Faculty wishes to acknowledge

```
responsibility.

```

1. The proposal is supported by a clear statement of the proposed action, including assurance of adherence to

```
specific University policies relevant to that action (e.g. assessment and external examination).

```

1. The proposal makes clear responsibilities and timeframes associated with the proposed action.
